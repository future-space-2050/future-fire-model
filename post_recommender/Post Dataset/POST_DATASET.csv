5063f90c-0652-4b6e-a6ff-dbd0d00f8177,sports,"Incident 1:

Jane Doe and her family were introduced to AG-affiliated church Ignite Life Center (ILC), located in Gainesville Florida, while attending services at Mariano and Clara Rivera’s church Refuge of Hope in New Rochelle, NY.

When Jane Doe arrived at the Ignite Life Center summer internship in Gainesville, she was housed with a much older minor girl who has been identified as MG. MG reportedly sexually abused Doe throughout the Summer Internship. 

The lawsuit states, “Ms. Rivera and her husband, Refuge of Hope employee/volunteer/agent Mariano Rivera, then traveled from New York to Florida to see Jane Doe at the Ignite Life Summer Internship. During that trip, the Riveras, in their capacity as agents for defendants, learned or should have learned information that Jane Doe was being sexually abused by MG. Rather than take sufficient action to end the sexual abuse of Jane Doe, the Riveras each separately isolated and intimidated Jane Doe to remain silent about her abuse by MG to avoid causing trouble for Refuge of Hope and the Ignite Life Summer Internship.” 

Incident 2:

The lawsuit reports that Doe also endured sexual abuse from the adult son of Refuge of Hope Associate Pastor Ruben Tavarez, Ruben Tavarez Jr. 

Tavarez Jr. reportedly groomed Doe and publicly displayed inappropriate affection with her. This continued until Tavarez Jr. sexually exploited her and continued his sex abuse by engaging in graphic electronic communications with Doe.  

Doe’s mother found out about Tavarez Jr. exchanging inappropriate pictures with her daughter, and Tavarez Jr. “admitted to his sexual misconduct with Jane Doe,” states the lawsuit.

Now the song's official music video is live action, of a king walking around various planes, beaches, and mountains with a folding chair, enjoying the vistas, or rather, the silence.

The video I'm thinking about was CG-animated and black and white. It was about an office building overgrowing with huge brown vines, destroying various parts of the building, even killing some of the workers off-screen (there's one employee who is shown twice, once alive, and again when the vines had overtaken him). As the vines are spreading, everyone is running, trying to save their work and themselves, there are some Gmen trying to contain the vines or something. The vines have buds, and at the end of the video the buds bloom into flowers. Then the shot pans out onto the roof, where all the flowers make up a giant rose that was on the cover of the song's album.

I just caught the original video on tv and remembered the CG one, and it got me wondering why they remade the music video, but when I went to wikipedia, there's no mention of the CG video, so it's either unofficial and somehow ended up on tv (I used to see it on MTV Rock), or the wiki page hasn't been updated in awhile. Or maybe it's not even Depeche Mode and I'm misremembering.

Anyway, can anyone help? I can't find it."

26e1aeeb-8aed-4bac-a9b7-2771f2bdd0aa,music,"so i got super into an album due to a movie that i’ve seen. the artist, Marc Morvan and ben jarry (no correlation to ben and jerry) made such a great album named Udolpho released in 2009. 
however and while there are additional albums, his most recent single is from 2016. 

my question, or request i guess, is has anyone else heard of them? if so, do they have a social? or are they more reserved and just release the music the. go back to their home? 

thanks in advance! "

It was one of the last shows of the 1981 US Tattoo You tour. Mick Taylor returned to make guest appearances at almost every show on their 2012/2013/2014 50 & Counting 50th Anniversary/14 on Fire Tours, playing on tracks that the band seemed were a right fit for him to play on. Former bassist Bill Wyman rejoined the band on November 25th and 29th, 2012 at the O2 Arena in London, England, playing bass on It's Only Rock n Roll (But I Like It) and Honky Tonk Women, the first two dates of the 50 & Counting 50th anniversary tour. Bill Wyman subsequently turned down more offers to join the band for further tour dates. 

Eagles - Bernie Leadon - During their 2013/2014/2015 History of the Eagles World Tour, former lead guitarist Bernie Leadon rejoined the band for the whole entire world tour. Bernie Leadon played on the whole entire first set, which was dedicated to his time in the band - the band's first four studio albums. Then, Bernie Leadon would rejoin the band for the final encore every night of the tour consisting of Take it Easy, Rocky Mountain Way by Joe Walsh and closing every show with Desperado. 

Guns N' Roses - Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan - During the first five shows of their 1993 European tour of the Use Your Illusion/Skin and Bones Tour, Izzy Stradlin rejoined Guns N' Roses and filled in for Gilby Clarke, who was recovering from a broken wrist in a motorcycle accident, after several shows on the North American Tour were already cancelled. Izzy Stradlin made several guest appearances on the band's 2006 Chinese Democracy tour, playing on songs that the band felt would be a great fit for him to play on - most of those being on the European tour, but he also joined the band at their May 17th, 2006 warm up concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, New York in addition to their three nights at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, Los Angeles, California on December 17th, 19th and 20th, 2006. Izzy Stradlin would later rejoin Guns N' Roses for several guest appearances at shows in 2012 at the O2 Arena in London, England on May 31st and June 1st, 2012 followed by a private gig on July 21st, 2012 in Saint-Tropez, France then at Trui Son Fusteret in Palma de Mallorca, Spain on July 22nd, 2012 and finally on November 23rd and 24th, 2012 at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Duff McKagan made guest appearances at three shows - On October 14th, 2010 at the O2 Arena in London, England in addition to two shows in 2011 - on December 16th, 2011 at KeyArena in Seattle, Washington and on December 17th, 2011 at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2014, Duff McKagan filled in on bass on several shows for Tommy Stinson, who went on tour with The Replacements, who reunited that year. In the early 2010s, Axl Rose and Duff McKagan were on good terms and were speaking to each other and they both made up years before he made up with Slash. 

R.E.M. - On October 10th, 2003 in Raleigh, North Carolina, former drummer Bill Berry rejoined the band on stage at the penultimate show of the band's In Time Greatest Hits tour. Bill Berry joined the band for their encore of Radio Free Europe (just on backing vocals and dancing around the stage) and Permanent Vacation. Bill Berry would subsequently play with R.E.M. for several charity events and awards ceremonies for the next several years during the decade. "

They made quite the wave in that decade, the Beastie Boys tried to push them in the USA for example (and re-released some of the tracks on their label), and they also collaborated with bands like Rage Against The Machine or artists like Merzbow.

I took some weeks to review all the albums they put out on their label. It's about \~40 releases, and they feature artists such as Atari Teenage Riot, Ec8or, Christoph de Babalon...

My aim is to spread awareness about this label, as I feel most of its catalogue is still sort of underrated... and it's some ""dame fine music!""

fe0a757b-d6b5-4ee1-b0af-06e669b10b8e,music,"The B-52s are one of the most innovative and influential bands in rock history, yet they remain absent from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their groundbreaking blend of new wave, surf rock, punk, and dance music set them apart, influencing generations of alternative and indie rock artists.

Formed in 1976 in Athens, Georgia, the B-52s helped pioneer the new wave movement with their self-titled 1979 debut, featuring *Rock Lobster* and *Planet Claire*. Their quirky style, infectious energy, and danceable rhythms bridged the gap between underground punk and mainstream pop. Their 1989 album *Cosmic Thing* brought them massive commercial success with hits like *Love Shack* and *Roam*, proving their ability to evolve while maintaining their distinct sound.

Beyond their music, the B-52s played a crucial role in breaking gender and LGBTQ+ barriers in rock. Frontman Fred Schneider, who is openly gay, brought LGBTQ+ visibility to mainstream music, while Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson challenged gender norms in rock. Their campy, inclusive aesthetic made them icons in queer culture, providing a safe space for misfits and outsiders.

Their influence extends far beyond their commercial success, shaping the sound and style of bands like R.E.M., Talking Heads, and LCD Soundsystem. With their unforgettable songs, visual appeal, and cultural impact, the B-52s have left an indelible mark on rock history. Their omission from the Hall of Fame is a glaring oversight that should be corrected to recognize their lasting contributions to music."

It's a chill music video. The first scene shows someone waking up, then walking on a pathway. They might have been hit by a falling piano or fallen into a drainage. But during the chorus, they simply walk out of a door. In the last scene, they pour water on themselves using a sprinkler, and the background features a movie theater."

I am writing to you because we have released our first single, Tormento, and in just a few days it has received plays from thousands of listeners around the world. We think you might be interested in raising a debate that would fit perfectly here: ""Is AI-generated music the future of music? How can we differentiate it from traditional music? What is going to happen to the artists?"" What is clear is that, today, songs can already be generated that are practically impossible to differentiate from traditional music and that sound like global hits.  
  
To contribute to the debate, we leave you our song ""Tormento"" which, despite being generated with AI, has been meticulously worked on both in terms of lyrics, vocalist style, instruments used, etc...  
  
We hope you like the idea.   
  
If you have any questions, we are at your disposal.

So this past week I downloaded airbuds and added some of my ""friends"" and despite they're extreme tiktok music taste, for some reason they constantly like to share with random people that I listen to JID and constantly tease me and tell me to tell me to kill myself because of it. I tried to stop this by making them listen to some of his music because it is very good but because they would like to find a reason to hate, they obviously had to pick the most annoying songs e.g. only listening to ""enemy"" that has him in for less than thirty seconds and ""surround sound"" which is extremely annoying because of how overplayed it is. Is it particularly bad to listen to him? because as far as I am aware, he is very highly rated, especially more recently and I really enjoy his music. "

In an ideal world I'd love to amass a physical collection, though I know physically released music is kinda dead these days. Not to mention I don't know whether any of the physical formats that did exist ever had audio quality ideal to the way masters were intended to be heard.

Aside from that though, whether it be digital downloads or another method of collecting, what would be the best way to consume music so that the actual music artists get paid? I hate spotify enough as it is, and I hate even more how it basically gives artists what might as well be a zero percent cut. Does it work different for digital downloads as opposed to listens/streams?

TL;DR want to collect music, what's the best way so that artists actually get paid?"

025dbba4-58ea-4fbb-b790-d0ef2045a4cc,music,"“I always trick you guys”, wrote Selena Gomez on an Instagram post announcing a new single, *Scared Of Loving You*, and an album due later this year. The news comes after several months of interview answers and other press material that hinted at Gomez stepping away from the music industry to fully pursue her acting career. Unfortunately, other than a slight tonal shift and the addition of some folky acoustic guitars, Gomez’s latest love song yields no new surprises.  

Several artists have made the transition from glossy pop to a more minimalist sound before, but artists like Taylor Swift harnessed the gentle acoustics and melancholic tones to put greater emotional emphasis on her vivid, diaristic writing. Gomez isn’t nearly as strong a lyricist, or a vocal presence, and her breathy, flaccid coos sink into the pillowy composition instead of popping out in contrast. 

The track features production credits from Gomez’s frequent collaborator FINNEAS as well as her fiancé, the serially risk-averse Benny Blanco. The latter’s inclusion should make this a recipe for supreme intimacy, but Gomez skates over any and all endearing details, instead coughing up stock lines like “'cause I'm not scared of lovin' you/I'm just scared of losin' you”. The singer may have made some stylistic transitions, but Selena Gomez continues to pull from an exhausted bag of tricks."

Uptown girl (Billy Joel) - Uptown is rich (and restricted) , downtown is poor and free, and wild. (The song makes sense, but the geography doesn't.  ""Downtown"" isn't poor in most cities? NYC, LA, Chicago - downtown is rich?  ""Downtown"" in this song seems to match the ""uptown"" from the others?

Uptown (Orbison) ""Uptown, in penthouse number three""  A match for uptown girl!

Uptown (Prince) - ""It ain't about no downtown, nowhere-bound, narrow-minded drag"", 

Uptown Funk (Ronson/Mars) - ""Hood girls"", ""Harlem"".  Uptown is ""hood"", but also where all the sexy free people are.  This seems like a complete flip from ""Uptown girl""

Uptown (Drake) - Doesn't really fit with the others imo, but seems to be making an uptown = rough/tough

Uptown (CMM, Turk). ~ Violent/Tough people come from uptown

Downtown (Petula Clark) ""No finer place for sure, downtown"" - less about class, and more about just a busy city?

Downtown (Niel Young) ""There's a place called Downtown Where the hippies all go""

Downtown Life (Hall & Oates) - Seems to be about gentrification of downtown, but the nightlife still being there?

Downtown Train (Tom Waits) - Girls from Brooklyn on downtown trains.  But are they going back home to Brooklyn after working in uptown? Or Headed to downtown to party? 

Downtown (Snoop) (LA vs the ""default"" NYC in most of these songs?) ""With beautiful people going downtown"""

I love reggae old and new, eek, yellow man, stick figure, you name it I probably enjoy it. But my GOD does it make me feel like I'm having a stroke listening to this music??? It can't be real, its so bizarre and low effort its damn near hard to not laugh listening. I feel bad for feeling this way if they are really trying but it's so goofy.

I don’t like Drake at all, but Kendrick was given his biggest performance stage,

And he made it about hating Drake, and all that’s wrong with America.

I’ve also noticed his fans love to call white ppl by cracker, & talk about how Kendrick isn’t for whites.

If you flipped this and made it a white artist talking about Blacks like this,

It would certainly be called out.

I’m not white, but this whole Anti-White & Anti-American stuff needs to stop.

I know our country has so much progress to make, but spreading hate & divide isn’t solving anything.

0f0e5f2e-0abe-4838-a08c-23aae57b3d0e,music,"Whitesnake - Still of the Night (1987) - in the style of Led Zeppelin - Still of the Night is from Whitesnake's 1987 self-titled studio album. Still of the Night is an example that blends Whitesnake's earlier blues rock sound of their first five studio albums with the band's more commercialized hard rock/heavy metal sound that the band got famous for, which made the band a big household name in the US. Still of the Night has an extended bridge reminiscent of Led Zeppelin tracks such as Dazed and Confused, Kashmir and Whole Lotta Love with David Coverdale mimicking Robert Plant's vocals on the track and even having a bit of Led Zeppelin's progressive rock phase in the track with its' near 7-minute length. 

Kingdom Come - Get it On (1988) - in the style of Led Zeppelin - Get it On is from Kingdom Come's 1988 self-titled debut studio album. Get it On is Kingdom Come's biggest hit, possibly widely known as one hit wonders, despite having the huge Zeppelin influence as a band as a whole. Get it On, in particular, bears a strong resemblance to Kashmir in particular with lead vocalist Lenny Wolf's voice bearing a striking similarity to Robert Plant. The track even concludes with drummer James Kottak playing a drum solo reminiscent of Moby Dick and Rock and Roll. 

Queensryche - Silent Lucidity (1990) - in the style of Pink Floyd - Silent Lucidity is from Queensryche's 1990 studio album Empire. Silent Lucidity is considered somewhat a black sheep hit for Queensryche and is somewhat different than their usual progressive metal sound, with the metal part of the genre being taken out and is a much more slower tempo orchestral ballad. Lead vocalist Geoff Tate's vocal style in this song bear a striking similarity to Roger Waters and the song in particular is compared to many eras of Pink Floyd - particularly their slower tempo ballads and with the song's orchestration, it's compared to albums such as The Wall and the period where Roger Waters led the band. 

Ronnie Wood - Worry No More (1979) - in the style of Bob Dylan - Worry No More is from Ronnie Wood's 1979 solo studio album Gimme Some Neck. Rolling Stones/former Faces lead guitarist Ronnie Wood has released several solo albums during his career, when The Rolling Stones have not been active as a recording and touring band. 1979 was a busy year for Ronnie Wood without The Rolling Stones and he formed a side project called The New Barbarians to tour in support of his solo album. Worry No More is his song in the style of Bob Dylan, who is a longtime friend of Ronnie Wood. The song was written by songwriter Jerry Lynn Williams. 

Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers - Refugee (1979) - in the style of Bob Dylan - Refugee is from Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' 1979 studio album Damn the Torpedoes. Tom Petty and Bob Dylan were known to be longtime friends for several decades. Bob Dylan invited Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers to tour as his backing band on his 1986/1987 world tour. After this, they both became bandmates in the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. 

Bob Dylan - Lay Lady Lay (1969) - in the style of Johnny Cash - Lay Lady Lay is from Bob Dylan's 1969 studio album Nashville Skyline. Nashville Skyline was Bob Dylan's attempt at making a full fledged country album, at which Johnny Cash himself appeared on. The album also featured Charlie Daniels as a session musician, before the formation of his namesake band. The album also featured several other country session musicians. 

Creed - Higher (1999) - in the style of Pearl Jam - Higher is from Creed's 1999 studio album Human Clay. Creed lead vocalist Scott Stapp's voice bears a strikingly similarity to Eddie Vedder. At the time of the song's release, grunge was out of business -  Nirvana and Soundgarden had both been disbanded - the former as Kurt Cobain was dead for five years already at that point, Alice in Chains was inactive due to Layne Staley's ongoing drug issues, Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots both moved to experimental directions and the latter was also having a difficult time dealing with lead vocalist Scott Weiland's ongoing drug problems. 

Temple of the Dog - Hunger Strike (1991) - in the style of Pearl Jam - Hunger Strike is from Temple of the Dog's only 1991 self-titled studio album. Technically, Hunger Strike is mostly made up of members of Pearl Jam, predating the release of the band's debut studio album Ten by several months - lead guitarist Mike McCready, rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard, bassist Jeff Ament and drummer Matt Cameron, who joined the band in 1998 and duet lead vocalist Eddie Vedder, which is technically the whole entire band. 

Stone Temple Pilots - Kitchenware and Candybars (1994) - in the style of Pearl Jam - Kitchenware and Candybars is from Stone Temple Pilots' 1994 studio album Purple. In Stone Temple Pilots' early career, Scott Weiland's voice bore a strikingly similarity to Eddie Vedder. The band's second studio album Purple was a change in style to the heavy sound of Core - Purple had a more melodic, diverse sound, dabbling in a wide variety of musical styles. Kitchenware and Candybars is a closing ballad with acoustic guitars, keyboards and strings. 

Humble Pie - 30 Days in the Hole (1972) - in the style of The Rolling Stones - 30 Days in the Hole is from Humble Pie's 1972 studio album Smokin'. Obvious, how it sounds very similar with the song's bluesy rock sound and the track's harmonica solo. And, with the track being released at the same time as The Rolling Stones' golden age classic era, it's just really obvious. The track is also notable for the absence of lead guitarist Peter Frampton, who left the band the previous year to start his successful solo career - as despite being a key member of the band and this song being their biggest hit, he was not on the recording, having left the band. 

Faces - Stay With Me (1971) - in the style of The Rolling Stones - Stay With Me is from Faces' 1971 studio album A Nod is as Good as a Wink.. to a Blind Horse. Again, another bluesy rock song released during The Rolling Stones' golden age classic era. The track is also notable as lead guitarist Ronnie Wood went on to become a member of The Rolling Stones several years later in 1975 after Faces disbanded. 

The Black Crowes - Jealous Again (1990) - in the style of The Rolling Stones - Jealous Again is from The Black Crowes' 1990 debut studio album Shake Your Money Maker. The Black Crowes were huge fans of classic blues rock and brought the genre back to the charts at the start of the 1990s. 

Rush - Working Man (1974) - in the style of Black Sabbath - Working Man is from Rush's 1974 self-titled debut studio album. When Rush first started, they were more of a bluesy rock band before Neil Peart joined. Rush's first studio album has more of a blues rock/hard rock/heavy metal vibe in the style of bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, The Who and many others. While the band still continued to experiment in the blues rock genre on the next two studio albums, the band very rarely (if ever) experimented in the genre ever again after 2112. 

The Wallflowers - 6th Avenue Heartache (1996) - in the style of Bruce Springsteen - 6th Avenue Heartache is from The Wallflowers' 1996 studio album Bringing Down the Horse. People primarily know The Wallflowers as a one hit wonder for the song One Headlight. However, key members of the band include lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jakob Dylan - Bob Dylan's son and keyboardist at the time Rami Jaffee, who went on to join Foo Fighters. 6th Avenue Heartache is the band's other notable song and features Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers lead guitarist Mike Campbell on slide guitar and Adam Duritz of Counting Crows. 

John Cafferty & the Beaver Brown Band - On the Dark Side (1983) - in the style of Bruce Springsteen - On the Dark Side is from John Cafferty & the Beaver Brown Band's 1983 film soundtrack Eddie and the Cruisers. On the Dark Side has often been misattributed as a Bruce Springsteen song as John Cafferty's voice in this song and the song's music both sound strikingly similar to Bruce Springsteen. With the piano intro and the song's saxophone solo, it's easily understandable to misattribute this song as a Bruce Springsteen song. 

Tommy Tutone - 867-5309 (1981) - in the style of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers - 867-5309 is from Tommy Tutone's 1981 studio album 2. Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers may be more well known for having their music closer to roots rock/Americana. However, believe it or not, Tom Petty blended their early sound with that with punk rock, new wave and power pop. So, this 1980s new wave/power pop song can be comparable to an early Tom Petty song. 

Greg Kihn Band - The Breakup Song (1981) - in the style of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers - The Breakup Song is from Greg Kihn Band's 1981 studio album RocKihnRoll. Another new wave/power pop song that is in the style of an early Tom Petty song despite Tom Petty's music being closer to roots rock/Americana. "

e56ce0e1-43ef-4f64-ade6-a57457cb1fcc,music,"I was thinking of this song in the shower earlier, and i thought of something I thought l'd share.
I believe the person we follow in this song is a schizo pilot, who is being
""followed"" by the lunatic from Brain Damage, or something simillar to it.
The song has faint airport PA system noises over the background, and heavy footsteps and breathing. Now this led me to think that the breathing and footsteps belong to a pilot, disorganized and late to the plane because they feel this lunatic is following them, and they must get to this plane and escape. Now the line ""Live for today, gone tommorow, thats me! Hahaha!"" is followed by a loud eerie mechanical noise. I assume this line is from this lunatic because of the laughter, which comes back soon.
Now the pilot is on the plane, but the laughter ensues again. The lunatic is on the plane. (The pilot at this point is having a full schizophrenic episode.)
This is shortly followed by the plane crash we hear.
I do know On the Run has its figurative meanings, but this is what I believe is literally happening throughout the track.


TL;DR: On the run follows a schizo pilot who is frantically running from something their mind has created, and while piloting the plane they experience a full schizophrenic episode and the plane crashes."

I hope you're all feeling fine and doing well 

I'm working on the album titled Sanski and I'm looking for a support which can help me to bring my songs to life 

Basically I'm a writer who can write lyrics out of any story which I ever come across but I struggle to turn that written work to musical work i.e. songs so requesting you guys to help me out.

I'm looking for those technical guys who have a knack in DAW, other musical softwares, music production, vocal production etc who will understand my musical ideas and help me out to turn them into reality. 

So anyone who is interested to collab/join with me as a band then reply to this post or dm me

Thanks.

When I was somewhere around 13-15 (2006-2008ish) my dad took me to the Los Angeles x games. It was great, awesome bonding time. 

At some point in between events, we went to kill some time at a small music stage for independent/unknown rock bands to play. It was pretty poorly attended while we were there but I saw a band I really fell in love with that day, and I bought their CD. An all-female punk sort of pop band.

Years later, I really wanted to listen again but that CD is long gone and I can’t for the life of me remember the name of the band. I just know if I saw it on a list or something that i would recognize it and it would all come back to me. Problem is, I can’t seem to find any kind of record of bands that have played such a stage at x games anywhere.

I know it’s a long shot that anyone would take record of the indie bands that played a tiny stage at a non-music festival, but if anyone has any idea where I might find some leads on this, please let me know because I am all out of ideas. "

2b74efd9-3b67-4503-804f-8c17efefca6b,music,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the market for a dynamic mic for live vocals, recording, gaming (probably an all purpose situation) good production quality is my priority though. I’m torn between three models: the sE Electronics V7, the sE Electronics V2, and the Behringer XM8500. I’ve noticed the price gap is pretty drastic—for example, the XM8500 can run as low as \~$15 while the sE V7 is generally around \~$100 (and the V2 sits somewhere in between).

**Here’s what I know so far and my thoughts:**

* ***^(sE Electronics V7:)*** *^(Many users have praise that V7 for its excellent sound quality, and it's a sm58 killer, I have also heard all the reviews and it does sound better)*
* ***^(sE Electronics V2:)*** *^(The V2 appears to be a more budget-friendly alternative to the V7 while still offering many of the same core benefits. Some reviews suggest it’s nearly as good as the V7. I’m curious if anyone has used both and can tell me how noticeable the differences are in day-to-day use.)*
* ***^(Behringer XM8500:)*** *^(This mic is just an another gem. The sound it offers is just extra ordinary for it's price. I hear it sounds much better than all the mic under 40 bucks. and competes very close to sE V2 mic, considering xm8500 is just 1/2 the price of sE V2)*

**Conclusion :**

I really like all these mics and I'm not a type of sm57/58 guy. sE v7 I want to buy but budget comes here as a problem, and few days of guilt is only the way I can afford it (I belong to a middle class family in India, and parent's hard earned money is the only option)  
I am more likely going to buy sE V2, but xm8500 has also caught my attention lately (especially it's price), and hence I'm confused.

NOW being a decent unprofessional music producer/engineer I could really don't care about the mic and use any decent mic to sound like sE V7, with post processing, (6 years of mixing experience), and ignore all those silly little, details in sound quality that don't really make any difference to a typical consumer.

so I really need some help at this point, I'm really bad at at making decision, has always stressed me out, every single time.

I’d really appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share. Thanks in advance!"

It is with a heavy heart that today we have to announce the North America tour planned for March 2025 will unfortunately have to be cancelled.
Due to health complications resulting from a recently diagnosed vocal cord strain (vocal cord nodules), it is currently impossible for me to perform the planned shows with the quality and intensity that you have come to expect and deserve.

This has not been an easy decision for me, but on the advice of experts and voice therapists, it is necessary to take a longer recovery period in order to fully regenerate my voice and avoid long-term damage.

Background: The concerts after the voice disaster in Berlin end of October 2024, i.e. in Hamburg, Hannover, South America, etc. unfortunately led to an unexpected strain which later had a negative effect in the studio during the vocal recordings and made singing almost impossible and now requires a medical intervention with a subsequent rest period of 6-8 weeks.

Whether we'll be able to try again in 2026 unfortunately depends on so many other factors and commitments that we can't promise anything concrete now and therefore can't simply postpone the North American tour, but have to cancel it.

I would like to thank you all for your continued support and understanding.
Steve Naghavi / And One"""

Oh, you haven't heard of them? [Stop lying](https://youtu.be/k_aQYP8rsgE?si=FkKOPx8ECB3B7FtA). 

But even then, that's far from their best song. From the same album alone, they've made [this](https://youtu.be/Bv5okx42-9g?si=i_MlVGsVgO8MCFea), [this](https://youtu.be/3FuncEJTH28?si=sXgaQ06drI6aE5Ig), and [this](https://youtu.be/1prhCWO_518?si=0JwwCVu5Gwm6OiUt)

That's not even breaking the surface of the ice when it comes to this band. Supermodel, their second and best album (in my humble opinion) knocked it out of the park with songs such as [Fire Escape](https://youtu.be/8Rz0npqmUvg?si=GAnPFY4sTRFqHSLm) and [Pseudologia Fantastica](https://youtu.be/5-mTcFGiVzw?si=8j7on3iFcV_fzJa_). These songs are genuinely the peak of artistic expression in the music industry, and why I believe indie as a genre trumps anything a label could put out.

And as for their other albums, Sacred Hearts Club and their more recent one, Paradise State of Mind, I'd recommend one from each. Listen to [Loyal Like Sid & Nancy](https://youtu.be/4EjMbiIu_vc?si=pGjcpsOl5-kPvRS_) and [Chasing Low Vibrations](https://youtu.be/J4zVmJUcBI8?si=ACvSyqLfHae4qg1x)

973f2b5b-3cfd-4108-afce-479503522e16,music,"When I was a little girl, I lived in a home where I was bullied not only by my only biological sister, but also by another person who abused me. We all lived together in my grandparents’ house, and whenever one would tease me, the other would join in. The pain was so intense, I would cry because they did things to purposely embarrass me in Front of others. The trauma still stays with me today.

 Around the age of twelve, I was listening to a little white and pink boom box my father had bought me. It was one of the last gifts he ever gave me. I had earphones in, singing my heart out in the living room, where my sister and my abuser were. I was lost in the music, carefree, when they told me I had such a beautiful voice that I should let them record me. They even said I could be a star and suggested I try going professional. Feeling flattered and naive, I let them record me, thinking I must sound amazing. But when they played the recording back, I was devastated. It sounded horrible. They laughed at me, made fun of me, and teased me relentlessly. They kept replaying it just to humiliate me more. What made it worse was that my sister took the tape and hid it, occasionally using it to blackmail me into doing whatever she wanted. This went on for about a year until I finally found the tape and destroyed it. The worst part was that when I tried to tell my mom and grandparents, they didn’t believe me. My abuser sided with my sister and accused me of lying. I still carry the effects of what they did. 

The anxiety and humiliation they caused stopped me from ever singing in Front of anyone. I sang in the top choirs in high school and had always dreamed of trying out for a solo, but the trauma of that one experience kept me from even attempting it. I worked on improving my singing, but it was always in private, out of fear of being humiliated again. 

Next year, I turn 50. Before this incident, being a singer was my dream, but I allowed fear and shame to stop me from pursuing it. Now, I’m older, a little rusty, and much different than that twelve-year-old girl, but the dream is still there—just in a different Form. I just want to overcome the fear of singing alone. I don’t want money or fame. I just want to record and sing one song—for myself, for my husband, for my children, and for my family to see that I’m not a bad singer—maybe a little rusty, but not as bad as they made me feel when I was twelve. This one thing has really affected me through the years.  This was probably one of my root causes as to why I have had such bad anxiety.

I feel better talking about it and sharing about it, but the scars will always be there."

60fc217f-da16-4fa9-8e0a-890b1bbdfca0,music,"Queen - Queen is not strictly a progressive rock band. However, it is one of the several genres the band has experimented with despite their lack of long songs over six minutes long. Queen has primarily experimented with the genre early on in their career blending in genres such as hard rock, glam rock, art rock, heavy metal, opera (noticing Freddie Mercury's operatic voice) as well as several others. In the 1980s, Queen moved towards a more pop rock sound blending in elements of dance and disco in their sound. On the band's final studio album with Freddie Mercury, 1991's Innuendo, Queen returned to their hard rock/art rock roots. 

Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin, despite being primarily thought of as a heavy blues rock band, primarily and mostly on their first two studio albums, were known to experiment with various other genres during their career, including progressive rock. Many people often even refer to them as a heavy metal band, having been one of the genre's originators. The band has frequently experimented in acoustic folk (mostly on III), reggae (D'Yer Mak'er), country, soft rock, funk and many other genres. 

Blue Oyster Cult - Blue Oyster Cult was often referred to as the American Black Sabbath. Both bands are known for being pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal. However, Blue Oyster Cult is often considered like a poor man's Black Sabbath - often regarded as a one-hit wonder - with (Don't Fear) The Reaper. However, the band had several other songs considered hits - notably, Godzilla and Burnin' for You. Blue Oyster Cult was known to blend elements of blues rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock and AOR/arena rock (in the 1980s) in their sound. 

Deep Purple - Deep Purple technically started off as a progressive rock/psychedelic rock band with their late 1960s Mark I lineup. Then, with their classic Mark II lineup moved towards a more harder rock sound - blending in elements of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. The band was known to experiment with the genre during any incarnation. 

Uriah Heep - Uriah Heep were essentially known as the poor man's Led Zeppelin, poor man's Black Sabbath and poor man's Deep Purple. Having been popular just during the same time as the other three bands but not gaining as much recognition as the other three, and like the other three bands, Uriah Heep has experimented with genres such as blues rock, folk rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock and on later 1980s recordings, AOR/arena rock and glam metal. 

The Doors - The Doors, despite being primarily known for their blues-influenced psychedelic rock sound, have frequently experimented in the progressive rock genre during their career. The Doors were also one of the rare rock bands that never had a bassist - instead relying on keyboardist Ray Manzarek to handle the bass duties on the keyboards. However, believe it or not, the band did use session musicians to supply the bass on their studio albums. 

Styx - Styx may be primarily part of the AOR/arena rock scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s but unlike all the other bands of the era, are more progressive rock-oriented. Styx also started off as a progressive rock band in their early years before Tommy Shaw joined the band moving the band towards a more commercialized AOR/arena rock sound. The difference in Styx was between Dennis DeYoung (progressive rock) and Tommy Shaw (AOR/arena rock), creating the tensions that the two have infamously become known for. 

Dire Straits - Dire Straits.. many people may think of Dire Straits as a rootsy bluesy rock band and with Mark Knopfler's bluesy country-based guitar style, kind of hard to believe that they're progressive rock. However, Dire Straits have frequently experimented in the genre - with many of their song lengths lasting over six minutes and some lasting even over ten, it would make sense to consider Dire Straits progressive rock. 

Radiohead - Radiohead may be a rare alternative rock example on this list. Radiohead began experimenting with the genre from 1997's OK Computer onward. The band shifted from the indie/guitar-based rock of the 1990s towards more experimental/electronic works at the start of the 2000s. 

Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath is widely known for being the first heavy metal band out there. The band launched the career of Ozzy Osbourne at the tail end of the 1960s. The band's earliest studio albums are heavily influenced by blues rock and psychedelic rock, having a somewhat professional rivalry to Led Zeppelin and being compared to the likes of Cream and Jimi Hendrix. The band would later frequently experiment in progressive rock and after the departure of Ozzy Osbourne, the band's sound became even heavier than it was. 

The Beatles - The Beatles - possibly the first example, maybe?! The Beatles were initially rooted in 1950s-influenced rock and roll in the band's early years but later moved towards a more folk rock and psychedelic rock sound, gradually getting more experimental as their career evolved - their music had more instrumentation than ever before with a full orchestra on several tracks. While it was not really progressive rock that The Beatles had experimented with, the genre was more or less proto-prog as progressive rock hadn't fully developed yet at the time The Beatles were still together. The Beatles would return to a more back to basics rock sound during their final years together as a band, although their experimentation still technically continued. "
a90caa45-73cc-4983-b7a1-598214d891ae,music,"Don’t get me wrong, Kendrick Lamar is a musical genius, but his fans are pretentious airheads. His music has depth, we get it. His lyrics are obviously incredible, nobody else has mastered the triple entendre with the same level of tact. 

I love Kendrick, but I resent the one-track mind of his fanbase. Be critical of his glorification of literal murderers, gang violence, etc., just because you haven’t seen it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t happen. Rich white kids listening to Kendrick and his broader genre directly correlates to increased violence in the communities that artists come up in (watch the linked Channel 5 video if you don’t believe me.)

None of this goes to say that Kendrick isn’t an incredible artist, it is almost indisputable that he’s one of the GOATs. His fans suck because they inadvertently fuel deep rooted neighborhood conflicts across the country by fan-girling gang affiliated artists.

I know this isn't much to go on but it's actually making me lose sleep now. I also know there are some people here that are true music gods that might just be able to help.

I'm not saying they, the individual musicians, should stop making music, but please find new ways and don't think about making a comeback. And here's why.
They're in the way of new bands. Radiostations, festivals, media and award shows (I'm looking at you Grammy's!)keep playing your music and write about it because they're a safe bet. And as an offshoot of this they helped kill rock music as more mainstream, because which fifteen year old kid can relate to Kiss or Lenny Kravitz. Yeh, Gene Simmons you can say rock is dead, but you helped killing it.
So rock bands; when you start to get near fourty: call it a day! And leave the stage to a new generation!

I don't have any facebook or insta so I just wanted to share my rant with you guys. Sending love to the families of the artists and our friends we've lost too soon. Fuck Depression, Fuck Addiction. Please ask for help if you need. Everyone needs help. Rant complete."

I am the Co-Founder of [nextsound.net](http://nextsound.net/) a platform dedicated to showcasing emerging dance & electronic music.

We are building a collection of the best up-and-coming Dance & Electronic music and a community of talented artists.

You can submit your tracks using a SoundCloud link, and we will feature you on the site. If you are featured you will get more streams for your tracks because we are receiving around 2000 visitors a week, and this number is rising exponentially. We are finding that tracks featured on Next Sound tend to get onto SoundCloud's algorithms such as ""The Upload"" and ""SoundCloud monthly""

It is also a chance to reach a wider audience and connect with artists, labels and industry people.

Our goal is to support talented artists in the dance/electronic music scene so it is completely free.

Looking forward to listening to your tunes and seeing you on there!"

I thought I should start with the easy ones like The Smiths, I did, I like them; but when I tried listening to the less mainstream ones, I almost slept.

I wanna know how to appreciate songs that don't have an obvious entertaining melody, but when I do, I hate every second of it. Can I genuinely change my taste? I don't want to stop listening to what I listen to now, but I want to know more. It's like even when I procrastinate, I chose the laziest form to do it.

When trying to build my discipline by listening to entire albums, I have to listen to the same song a million times, for when it ends, not one second was memorable; and I can't force myself to like it.

I know I don’t have to, but it's exhaustive to be basic. Please help me."

The most obvious being a song called Albatross which is a direct rip from Bob Dylan's Hurricane. From chord progression and strumming pattern, to the vocal cadence and twisting of original lyrics. HE EVEN TOOK THE MAIN HOOK RIFF. It's honestly sad and pathetic but what makes it worse is that when confronted he denies the claim yet knowing Bob Dylan. In fact he claims he mostly rips off Clapton. That isn't the only song that's a rip either. Sky's Real Slow is also another damn near copy of Dylan's Knockin on Heavens Door. He has also taken many other works Titles such as Midnight Special. This wouldn't be such an issue if this guy wasn't getting local ""publicity"" because these people are ignorant to the plagiarism. Not to mention he also recently dropped a new song with a washed up rapper who he's practically on his knees for with the collab. Both of these artist are notorious for using Al as well. Very apparent. And when he was criticized on his new song he decided to write FAKE REVIEWS and post them on social media. He wasn't even able to accumulate 10 likes all together on any posts across all socials. Look I know l'm probably gonna get labeled as a hater but see from my view as an up and coming struggling artist and an audiophile.
These aren't the only claims about this guy. Aside from his fraud as an artist he's also a terrible person in general. From abuse, to child abandonment, anger issues, and creeping on women but just ar' anyone in the Indy scene and they'll tell you. Mi V reason he's legally changed his name every three years and even moved county's and towns."

83bb3f3e-ed56-4a5d-901e-34899a3706e6,music,"One of my favorite parts of discovering great new music is when I find a deep cut that was never released as a single (or was a fifth single, or was the second single from an EP) that I only really discovered by chance (or from buying the album). 

I know there must be tons of songs like that, so I'm always on the lookout for great stuff by bands I already know, especially from my favorite genre, 90s alt-rock. Here are but a few examples, both to show what I mean and to spread the love about these wonderful songs if you don't know them already.

[Soundgarden - The Day I Tried To Live](https://youtu.be/jwDlcx3HWAU?feature=shared) (pretty sure this was the fifth video from Superunknown)

[Pearl Jam - Mankind](https://youtu.be/54nPK_f-IYw?feature=shared) (off No Code; I once shared it with a friend and asked him to guess who it was, and he guessed The Ramones)

[Stone Temple Pilots - Seven Caged Tigers](https://youtu.be/jVb7XdQIhYs?feature=shared) (off Tiny Music)

[Nirvana - Lounge Act](https://youtu.be/dZqpol8Yrq8?feature=shared) (great album you've probably never heard of)

[Alice In Chains - I Stay Away](https://youtu.be/SxygdAPJqDw?feature=shared) (this one got some airplay but it was the second single off an EP, and so unlike all their other stuff)

[Smashing Pumpkins - Frail And Bedazzled](https://youtu.be/ZaQxUTpaCEk?feature=shared) (from the odds-and-sods album, and not the single)

[Barenaked Ladies - War On Drugs](https://youtu.be/3rWVeFzSrL0?feature=shared) (I just think it's neat)

[They Might Be Giants - Sensurround](https://youtu.be/qxx5CABtI0M?feature=shared) (I could do this all day with just TMBG songs)

[Ben Folds - Gone](https://youtu.be/LR4Z8LCK5jc?feature=shared) (emotional banger from his first solo album)

[The Cranberries - Ridiculous Thoughts](https://youtu.be/z23q9Le0fOw?feature=shared) (third single from No Need To Argue, and I thought it didn't get anywhere near enough love)

[Green Day - Armatage Shanks](https://youtu.be/YnHtIUY7WZ0?feature=shared) (I heard this on the 1994 VMAs and it blew my little mind, and I'll never understand why this wasn't the single from Insomniac)

I could go on. So what are your favorite deep cuts? I'd love to hear suggestions that aren't JUST 90s alt-rock, too, of course, but you get the idea."

Basically you walk around collecting songs from various genres, do quests for more songs, trade with others and play minigames related to music like Aux Battles or Artist Guesser. There are lots of songs in any location, and it allows you to get them while in a car or public transportation too, which is a cool way to kill time on your daily commute.

It has been a lot of fun and besides collecting music from my favorite artists and getting badges to show off for it, it also helps me discover some new music, inspires me to go out and it's fun to trade songs within the community. 

It's completely free to play but there is a premium version that you can unlock by inviting 8 friends. I just need 5 more invites so I am here promoting the game to see if anyone would be interested and kind enough to use my invite link for the download lol 

If you would do it, DM me for the link (they're individual links) and I will gift you a rare song from my collection based on your music taste to help you get started!

Also, if anyone here plays other mobile games or apps that you need to refer new users to, I would be happy to swap links and do yours in exchange. 😁 You don't have to keep playing either if you don't like the game, only making an account and opening a drop already works for me. But hopefully you will love this game like I do!

If you got interested in the description but don't really want to use my invite link, it's just called Soundmap and available for both iPhones and Android, go ahead and try it out 💚

And of course, if you are already a soundmapper and want to trade, lmk. My username is moondust. (with the period at the end). 

Thank you :) "

Now they have 2 monthly listeners which are my friend and me. Its crazy they didn't blow up their songs are really good and they have 2 albums which both came out in 2008 and an EP which came out in 2005. The song I liked the most was stab me in the side, hope they gain some recognition."

I've been confused for quite a while now and i'm not sure if has some sort of meaning or if it's just from whoever made the 3d animation/models for it.

8bbe6f7a-da9c-44af-b78d-6689c1031189,music,"For me, I tye songs to specific memories and milestones. I organize my offline tracks (stored on my hard drive/phone) into folders named after life events. For example, in 2019: ""The Party—Where I Met My Soulmate."" Whenever I hear a song in the wild that hits me during a meaningful moment—like the 3 tracks playing when I first talked to them—I save it to that folder. Revisiting these tracks later feels like time-traveling back to that exact emotion. Over the years, I’ve built 18 folders marking everything from road trips to breakups to random golden-hour walks. Each one is a curated snapshot of my life. Anyone else do something similar? How do you organize your offline music to keep it personal and meaningful?"

The commonality of the reports seem to be that they have been trying to use the Android reddit app to post. So if this problem has been bugging you, please report it to Reddit in the android app store. Until it's fixed you can post your art in the web browser on a computer.

And yes, we know the app seemingly allows posting on other subs, and not on /r/Art. But the iPhone app works fine (tested myself). It probably has to do with the title requirements that this sub has, it uses a thing called regex, and I suspect this title requirement is causing the android app to not function correctly."

I am writing this on reddit anonymously because of I have learnt the hard way that people change when there is money involved. 

I have tried not to mention to my parents that I have earnt around 100k in the last three months. 
Yet, my dad has been angry at me for being secretive with money so in the end I told him that I made 5k last month.

Even with that deflated number the energy in the room changed. 

Everyone has always thought of me as someone who has been stupid with money as ever since I was a small kid I have tried my hand in many different side hustles. 

And most of the time lost money with them. 

It almost felt as it was hard for my dad to accept the fact  that I had finally succeeded even when I severely undercut what I actually earnt. 

At school I opened up my new macbook for the first time (very subtly when there were only a few people around) yet everyone assumed I was flexing. I told them it wasn’t even the newest model and that I found a good deal on amazon yet it still felt like a me vs them vibe in the room. 

Is it worth the blood, sweat and tears of working hard for money, just for it to make you unhappier?

EDIT: Great advice and lovely feedback from everyone. To clarify I have been involved in a space (crypto) for around half a year. But as it is such a fast moving enviroment there are new problems that arise every single day. So whenever I bump into these problems I try to fix them.
I believe the key is to ask for alot of feedback (for example I send atleast 40 dms to people asking for suggestions and feedabck every new tool). AND looking at it from the consumers point of view, so whether one likes it or not it typically comes down to who has the best UI instead of best backend. 

I cannot stress enough how important it is to attract attention in innovative ways. My basic plan goes like 1. Find problem 2. Create tool 3. Improve 4. Get a BUNCH of influencers and KOLs equity or atleast generous refferals (if you make the influencer alot of money they will promote the shit out of the product) 5. repeat."

1094cc69-1f21-469e-ab8c-a3ad28b7f811,Entrepreneur,"I’ve built my career by essentially being a surgeon for one very specific problem as a consultant. Now, one of the biggest legacy names in my industry wants to hire me full-time. This is an insane opportunity for an incredible company. Respectable pay. And if I pull off what my goal is with them, would put me on another level of credibility. 

Their reputation is massive, but they’ve fallen into irrelevancy over the last decade due to lack of adaptability. I know exactly why they’re struggling and exactly how to turn this part of the business I'd be responsible for around.

The W2 structure is what is killing me. The artificial ceiling on income is one thing, but my bigger issue is half of my job description could be done by a burger flipper level employee, keeping my attention fractured from making meaningful change.

I pressed on this point as much as I felt I ethically could. I asked them why they are so focused on \_\_\_\_\_. They respond with an answer you'd find in a surface level best practices article. I asked, ""so have you seen any results from doing \_\_\_\_?"" They answered with a laugh, ""No - not at all."" But sort of held firm in that corporate way that it's still half of the job.

How do you navigate this? 

I'm very confident in the impact I can have. I know exactly how I can help. While the job is fully remote, It's still a 9 to 5. One week's vacation. Bureaucracy and Monday morning zoom calls. Every reason that we are in this subreddit because of.

On the flip side: There are aspects of my life right now where consistency and letting my foot off the gas in lead generation and worrying about my future would be nice to say the least. (health in the family). I would also service current clients too. And I cannot stress this enough, this is a ""dream client"" type of account. Just a lot to consider. 

By the way if it’s not obvious: I have no prior relationship with them."
c512785d-d38b-4c1f-a1b9-c79e764a7058,Entrepreneur,"Hi all,

14 months ago, I left a company I worked for, and was looking for a new job.

I failed after 1000+ applies.

Told about this to my best friend (whom I can call a brother), and after we agreed that we both are broke, we decided to open up as a company and sell websites/apps in Azerbaijan.

We made a logo, name (Plum), instagram/facebook and after 3 months of buying ADS on Meta, we got our first client (600$).

We invested 50% of those money into ADS and got another client in 3-4 weeks (1200$).

Then we made a mistake, on holidays, you SHOULD NOT buy ads and we lost money on that.

Lesson learned, and we continued later and got more clients (800$ and 2300$).

And then another fail, during the summer we spent 600$ and got 0 clients (seems like same as holidays, summer doesn’t work lol).

In September we started again buying ADS and got 2 more projects. Recently our client came back and ordered again + updates for his old website.

I’m so glad that we started this business! So much exp and even now we earn money from, we decided to expand to USA(email outreach) and to other countries (learning how ADS works) cause orders in Azerbaijan are not enough.

That’s it, we still work, we continue grinding!

Thanks all for reading."

4356017f-04b2-46ce-83d0-e3410326c5c9,Entrepreneur,"I'll be honest: I hate sales. I like talking to people, but figuring out proper pricing, marketing, and sales is something that completely drains me. What I do love however, is programming. I've been doing it for close to a decade now and I have many saas-like projects under my belt that never really amounted to anything.

So if you have a (validated) idea, there seems to be some kind of market for it, and you're confident that with a good product we can make some money, DM me. I can have an MVP out in no time as I have had a lot of practice over the years...

I'm available part time at the moment!

86e2eb50-7666-48fe-a7c6-639f7870641e,Entrepreneur,"Just wanted to share my journey building Answer HQ, an AI customer service assistant for small businesses and startups. Started this as a side project after getting laid off last September, and yesterday we hit $750 MRR (will share Stripe proof in comments, cant post links)! I don't claim these are big numbers, but I'm a big believer in building in public + celebrating small wins.

Some quick stats:

1. Growth: Doubling MRR every 1.5 months through pure word-of-mouth
2. Marketing: Building on TikTok (@answer.hq) with AI tips, almost at 6k followers. Pure awareness play. 
3. Pricing: Started at $9/$29 in Sept 2024, moving to $99/$299 next week. All early customers grandfathered in - they believed in us first, gotta treat them right
4. Running this solo alongside my day job, 80% margins

Learned the following along the way

* Stay laser-focused on customer needs, not engineering curiosity (hard for us technical founders, but really important since I work a FT job too)
* Be exceptionally responsive with support - landing the deal is the easy part. I setup monthly check-ins with all paying customers. 
* Test pricing aggressively while demand is strong. I still have room to grow. 
* Source new features purely from customer feedback and need. Don't build useless shit! 
* Build in public and celebrate the small wins

I go no coworkers to share wins, which is the shittiest thing about building solo. But do really appreciate this community. Happy to answer any questions about the journey. "

I'm currently 33. and I've been a 9-5 worker since my graduation (financial industry)

Want to know something cool?

You can add a 30% sales conversion rate just with a sticky note.

I know, sounds like I'm drunk or something 😅

But I don't drink. 😒

Anyway, Dr Randy Garner a Professor of Behavioral Sciences at Sam Houston State University.

Says the same as I do about the sticky.

In fact, he already made his own study on the effect of adding a sticky note, on the conversion rate.

What he did was simple.

He sent a survey request to all the faculty members, but...

He divided them into 3 groups.

**1 The sticky note group:** Received the survey request with a cover letter and handwritten message on a sticky note.

**2 The cover letter group:** Received the same message of the sticky note but on the cover letter.

**3 Control group:** Received the survey with a standard cover letter without the handwritten message.

Now, you might not expect a big of a difference, since he just added a small message on a small piece of paper that sticks to other paper 🙂

Well, I guess the results speak for themselves:

**1 The sticky note group:** 76% response rate.

**2 The cover letter group:** 48% response rate.

**3 Control group:** 36% response rate.


That's MASSIVE, between including a sticky note or not, there's a 211.11% increase in response rate. 🤯

See, **I told you I'm not drunk...**

But, maybe the results were SO massive only because the sticky note was eye catching with it's bright colors?

Which made people pay attention more to the survey?

Well, Dr Randy had the same question as you do...

And in fact, he made another experment to test this.

In the second experment, he tested the same survey request accompanied with:

**1 The same handwritten message on a sticky note*** and a cover letter.

**2 An empty sticky note** and a cover letter.

**3 Only the cover letter.**

How much of a difference do you think will happen here?

Well, I gotta say, it's weird what he got.

**1 The handwritten message sticky note:** same as before 76% response rate.

**2 The cover letter only:** same as before 36% response rate.

But...

**3 The empty sticky note:** 43% response rate.

Now, WTF!?!

Just the presence of the sticky note added a 7% response rate.

But add 2 words on it and you get a 211.11% increase in response rate!?

WHAT!!?

Well, I know...

Sounds crazy, but it did.

Now, let's discuss what kind of Brazilian sorcery just happened in those experments.

First, you gotta know that there's several psychological triggers involved in making those results. 

Which we talked about one of them before. (**Reciprocity**; because they appreciated the effort of handwriting the message to them)

But our main trigger here is **Personalization.**

See, in the handwritten sticky note, the participants felt that it's unique and made specifically for them.

Not just a generic cover letter everyone got.

That's why every opt-in page on the planet asks for the email and the first name.

So when they send a promotional email, 

they make it personal by mentioning his name.

Now, how can you take advantage of this personalization system?

Well, there are endless ways you can leverage the personalization effect to increase conversions.

For example, making your landing page target a very niche personal ICP.

Instead of targeting Fred the real estate agent (which there's many types of real estate agents, all living a different set of lives), 

Instead, you can go with Freddy the flipper.

Now instead of shitting yourself to make your message super general to satisfy all real estate agents, 

You can make it personal to Freddy the flipper.

You can use the lingo he uses, the personal daily struggles he have, the personal dreams, desires, fears, problems...

The possibilities are limitless here, the more niche you go, the more personal it get.

And the more sales you make.

Because you're not trying to reach everyone, but one Individual person.

So go out there and find your personal ICP.

Hope this makes sense.

And see you in the next one, buddy.

f34ce8de-3dad-4fc1-b18a-8a55075bf653,Entrepreneur,"When I first started diving into startup growth, I kept hearing the same advice:  Find Product-Market Fit, and everything else will follow.

And sure, having a great product that solves a real problem is key. But what they don’t tell you is…

Messaging-Market Fit is just as important.

Let me explain.

I was recently analyzing n8n’s landing page evolution from 2019 to 2025, and something clicked. Their hero section messaging changed at every stage—and it wasn’t just random rebranding.

It was a deliberate shift to match their growth stage, audience, and positioning.

Here’s how their messaging evolved (and why it mattered):

🔹 2019 → “Open Source Alternative for Zapier/tray.io”  
 Targeted developers by piggybacking on a well-known competitor.  
 Clear differentiation, easy to understand.

🔹 2020 → “Extendable Workflow Automation”  
 Dropped competitor mentions and focused on flexibility.  
 Started attracting a broader open-source audience.

🔹 2022 → “Automate Without Limits”  
Positioned for business teams, not just tech users.  
Emphasized scalability and adaptability.

🔹 2023 → “Build Complex Automations 10x Faster, Without Fighting APIs”  
Messaging became benefit-driven.  
Directly addressed a key pain point: API complexity.

🔹 2025 → “Secure, AI-Native Workflow Automation”  
 Now targeting enterprise buyers.  
 Focused on security and AI—hot trends for B2B decision-makers.

So, What’s the Lesson Here?

 \- Your messaging needs to evolve with your startup.  
 \- Early adopters need a different pitch than enterprises.  
 \- Product differentiation matters at first, but benefits & outcomes drive scale.  
 \- You don’t just sell a product—you sell the right story, at the right stage.

This shift from Product-Market Fit → Messaging-Market Fit is something many startups overlook.

But if you don’t adapt your messaging as you scale, you’ll lose the audience you’re trying to reach.

So, if you’re working on a startup, ask yourself:  
 \*Is my messaging aligned with where my company is today?  
\*Does my homepage speak to the audience I actually want to convert?

# What Do You Wish Existed?

So, **what book have you searched for but never found?** What topic or problem do you wish someone would cover in a truly helpful book?

For example, maybe you've looked for:

* A practical guide for a specific challenge or niche topic where you came up empty-handed.
* A fresh take on a common issue (mental health, career, relationships, etc.) that existing books don't address the way you need.
* Any other kind of book that you *know* could help you or others, but it just doesn't seem to exist yet.

I'm open to any and all ideas you have. (This isn't a promo or some marketing trick – I genuinely want to know what **you** feel is missing out there!) Your suggestions will point me in the right direction to create something that could actually make a difference.

I’d like to start by saying that I’ve been in entrepreneurship for almost 15 years. One thing I’ve learned is that doing business alone is nearly impossible. Over the years, I’ve launched five different ideas—some succeeded, some didn’t.

But here’s my question: How do you keep your partners engaged in the idea?

In all my ventures, we start with enthusiasm, everyone contributes equally at the beginning, but once the actual work begins, I end up taking on 90% of the responsibilities, while the others always seem to be “too busy” with something else. I’ve tried working with completely different people, yet the result is always the same.

In our latest project, we’re launching a mobile app, and for the past few months, I’ve done the coding, created the designs, managed contributor communications—and now I’m expected to handle the marketing as well.

But we really need 2,000 active customers to be fully self-sustaining. With zero marketing budget, growth has been slow - based solely on founder social media efforts.

Sure, more features will improve our value proposition, but our customers tell us we offer value (all of whom left competitors). We just need to found a couple thousand more of these ecommerce sellers.

Is it time for me to do something really big and bold to get the word out faster? How about offering lifetime free membership?

The fact that most of our customers pay less than $20 a month means that even people who use our service don't find a year free all that compelling.

What do you think? Would a bold offer of lifetime membership be just the kind of thing a bootstrapped startup like mine should consider? Would an offer like this just seem ridiculous and look desperate?

It was brutal. I paid them severance (2 weeks for every year they’ve been with the company) and am paying benefits for a period too. 

I’ve been on calls all day, and I feel like I’ve felt every human emotion in one day. I’ve had a good cry over it. 

I’ve learned a lot about the narratives and things said, that of course reaffirm that I made the right choice, but times like this are just awful. I feel like a worthless leader on many fronts…. Everything from I hired the wrong people, or I didn’t manage it the right way, resentment for building a remote business that keeps me from knowing enough about the front lines. Or, I trusted too much. And resenting strategies that failed. The list goes on and on…. 

But I care about these people. They are humans. They were under my care and I feel like I failed them. 

Of course this takes all accountability off them and puts it on me, but it feels incredibly lonely. Not sure many people have any clue what this part of the glamorous entrepreneur life is like. 

I created this. It’s my problem, and my fault. 

And…. This adjustment, helps right size things. We will be fine, and better off with this change. I have about 50 people in my business with many capable people willing and able to step up, but how do I know I can trust them? What if I mess up again. 

And then I think, I’ve learned so much from this journey…. I wish I could scrap it all and start over now that I know what I know.

My neighbor who I used to live with is a very ambitious dude who likes to resell things on his own . I have always talked to him about my business and recently in November he decided to join me . We have been going back and forth about percentages of what we should both take on each product that he invests/ helps with . The most recent percentages we have left off at is 42.5% for him and the rest for me but I pay the warehouse $1250/monthly and he invests 100% of the money for the products that I sell ( he doesn’t worry about the sales)  . With these percentages I’m able to use my warehouse however I like . If I find something that is free to me I get to keep 100% of the earnings which is not rare but also not common.  He is coming in a couple of hours a week 3-5 mostly all in 1 day and helping out with pick ups some days apart from the 3-5 hours. He can argue that he has a full time job and this business is my full time job that’s why he can’t come in more often. Most of the pick ups / drop offs are done by me and most of the items do not need work. I like the partnership we have but the percentage he is taking out of my business is a lot in my eyes but I’d like to hear someone else’s thoughts on this . My expenses are: gas,wear on my van, rent , tools and other small things to fix the products . His are : his money that is being invested into the business , sometimes gas when he picks ups (rare since we are in my van most of the time when we pick up ), and his tools which he already had . I want to know if this is a lot of percentage he’s taking and if I’d be better off on my own . If I’d ask him to stop being my partner I’m afraid he’d go and start reselling the same stuff I am on his own since I already taught him everything .

On a daily basis we all hear about loneliness and the difficulty for many people in creating deep meaningful relationships with new people, more so the older we get.

So I built an app, you create an event, other people browse event profiles, and they opt to join events, basically a ""tinder for events"", any kind of event.

The app is dormant, I haven't been successful with digital promotions and flyers. Whilst feedback has been very positive it still requires critical mass to work ie. With only a few people nobody will engage with posted events which are geo specific, and people don't come back after one look. However I don't have $100ks to spend on marketing.

The app is already monetized, users get 1 free guest to their event, additional guests require payment.

Tldr; I'm looking for someone that might be able to take ownership of the app and its growth with a majority stake ownership in revenue.

If I've tweaked your interest you can check it out, it's called ""solo bee"" on the app store, only currently available in a handful of countries on Apple and play stores. Search for ""solo bee app store"" otherwise SEO ranking is low.

Dm me if you are genuinely interested, and have experience in app growth hacking. I feel like this app could be successful but I don't have the skill set or the passion when it comes to marketing and I have since moved on to other ideas.

dcad0308-eb18-4c3c-801e-61c2d14e181b,Entrepreneur,"**1. Idea Generation**

* **Solve your own problems:** The best ideas come from problems you experience firsthand.
* **Be original:** If you're doing what everyone else does, you'll struggle to stand out.
* **Start small, then expand:** Find a niche, dominate it, then move into adjacent markets.
* **Execution matters more than ideas:** A mediocre idea with great execution wins over a great idea with poor execution.

**2. Building the Product**

* **Build fast, launch early:** Avoid perfectionism; ship an MVP quickly and iterate.
* **Use the tools you know:** Don’t waste time learning new frameworks if you can build with what you already know.
* **Do it yourself (DIY) vs. outsourcing:** Learning to code gives you speed and control; outsourcing can slow you down.
* **Keep costs low:** Bootstrap to maximize freedom and avoid premature scaling.

**3. Launching**

* **Launch multiple times:** Don’t wait for a “perfect” launch—release early and improve based on feedback.
* **Target the right platforms:** Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, niche communities, and industry forums.
* **Engage with real users:** Your first customers are your best marketers.

**4. Growth Strategies**

* **Growth starts with a great product:** If people truly need your product, they will share it.
* **Stay lean:** Don’t hire until you have revenue; even then, keep teams small.
* **Leverage organic channels:** Content marketing, SEO, social media, and community building are more sustainable than paid ads.
* **Automate everything possible:** Reduce manual work so you can focus on scaling.

**5. Monetization**

* **Charge users directly:** Avoid relying on ads or selling user data; transparency builds trust.
* **Experiment with pricing:** Start low, test different pricing models, and optimize.
* **Build recurring revenue:** Subscription models create stability and predictability.

**6. Automating & Scaling**

* **Automate repetitive tasks:** Use scripts, bots, and workflows to free up your time.
* **Delegate when necessary:** Hire contractors for tasks that can’t be automated.
* **Avoid over-hiring:** Small, efficient teams win over large, bloated organizations.

**7. Exiting & Long-Term Success**

* **Don’t chase acquisitions:** Build something profitable and let buyers come to you.
* **Negotiate smartly:** Value your business aggressively, get paid in cash, avoid earn-out clauses.
* **Emotional impact of selling:** Selling a business can be hard—be prepared for post-sale emotions.

**8. Ethics & Longevity**

* **Be ethical:** Don’t spam, manipulate users, or fake growth—transparency is a competitive advantage.
* **Own your mistakes:** Apologize and improve when things go wrong.
* **Play the long game:** Sustainable businesses focus on long-term value, not short-term wins."

I hope you're doing well. M 24-year-old from India with an engineering background in electronics and computers. After working as a Business Development professional in digital asset management (NFT management)  I've decided to pursue my true passion: building an Ayurvedic healthcare brand.

I'm currently in the beta testing stage for a new venture that focuses on Ayurvedic multi-mineral and vitamin pills suitable for people of all genders and ages (16+). The idea is to offer a holistic, natural product to support overall well-being, and I am deeply committed to bringing this vision to life. 

My Aim is to export the products to markets where ayurvedic healthcare is growing rapidly,
USA , Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Australia. MADE IN INDIA to it's peak. 

I'm looking for a like-minded Co-Founder , to join me on this exciting journey. The role does not require any funding at this stage. I am in the process of testing the concept and finding a few dedicated people who are passionate about Ayurveda and holistic health. Your experience in the wellness or healthcare sectors would be an added bonus, but more than anything, I’m looking for someone who shares the same passion for this industry.

I will be working full-time on this project, alongside preparing for some personal examinations, so I am dedicated to pushing this venture forward.

If you’re interested or have any questions, feel free to reach out. I'm eager to connect and see if we’re a good fit for this journey.

I have thought of the name of the company in case you wonder 😉

2e155db5-1339-49ca-8e4f-c92cea867ffd,Entrepreneur,"Just wrapped up launching on Product Hunt, and let’s just say… the system is more brutal than ever. If you're planning a launch, here are some hard truths you need to know:

**If you don’t get featured, you’re screwed.** You could be in the top 3 by votes and still not get the ""Product of the Day"" badge. No feature = no real visibility.

**How do you get featured? Nobody knows.** Product Hunt’s editorial team changed the rules – getting featured is now three times harder than it was a year ago.

**There’s a trick.** An hour before launch, check if your post says *Featured on \[date\]* instead of *Posted on \[date\].* If not, you’re out. But sometimes, reaching out to Product Hunt support and asking to reschedule works – about 50/50 depending on who you get in support.

**Upvotes alone won’t save you.** If you do get featured, then it's a battle for votes. Your community and outreach should be warmed up at least a month in advance. One of the best tricks? Get people to follow your teaser page on Product Hunt beforehand – they convert well into upvotes.

**Paid upvotes? Test before trusting.** Some services can deliver up to 500 “surviving” votes, but Product Hunt has a weird filtering system that cuts votes every hour. Some work, some don’t.

And this is all on top of the basics. A properly filled-out profile, active engagement in comments before launch, and strategic seeding in relevant groups and chats all make a difference. Voters can’t just click an *Upvote* link and be done. Product Hunt tracks organic activity, so voters need to search for your product manually, browse the page, and interact before voting. Otherwise, votes get slashed.

**TL;DR – The Product Hunt algorithm is a black box, but if you don’t get featured, you might as well close your laptop and go chill.  My product  on PH as proof  - Marketowl**

Has anyone else noticed how much harder it is to launch successfully lately?"
d33d5cd3-f4e2-4f69-8c51-ad89c68df829,Entrepreneur,"If you’re looking to purchase, renovate, or refinance **owner-occupied commercial real estate**, the **SBA 504 and 7(a) loan programs** offer competitive financing options that can help preserve capital while securing favorable loan terms. These programs provide lower down payments, longer repayment terms, and flexible structures—making them excellent alternatives to conventional CRE financing.

# SBA 504 Loan – Best for Long-Term Real Estate Ownership

Ideal for purchasing or refinancing commercial real estate, major renovations, and large equipment purchases.

* **Lower Down Payment** – As little as **10%**, helping businesses retain working capital.
* **Long-Term Fixed Rates** – The **CDC portion** (up to 40% of the loan) offers **fixed** interest rates, reducing exposure to market fluctuations.
* **Larger Loan Amounts** – Total financing can exceed **$20 million** with proper structuring.
* **Equity Preservation** – Allows businesses to invest in growth rather than tying up cash in real estate.

Typical Structure:

* **50%** from a conventional lender
* **40%** from a Certified Development Company (CDC), backed by the SBA
* **10%** borrower equity (may increase for special-use properties)

# SBA 7(a) Loan – A More Flexible Financing Option

Designed for real estate purchases, renovations, working capital, and even business acquisitions.

* **Lower Down Payment** – Generally 10% but can be structured with **no cash down** for existing business owners, keeping more cash in the business.
* **Versatility** – Can be used for **real estate and other business expenses**, including working capital and equipment.
* **Longer Terms** – Up to **25 years** for real estate, ensuring manageable payments.
* **No Balloon Payments** – Unlike some conventional CRE loans, **7(a) loans fully amortize** over the term.

**Key Requirement:** The business must occupy at least **51% of an existing property** (or **60% for new construction**).

# Which Program is the Right Fit?

* If the goal is long-term real estate ownership with the best fixed rates, the SBA 504 is a strong choice.
* If flexibility is a priority—such as combining real estate financing with working capital—the SBA 7(a) provides more options.
* In some cases, both programs can be used together to maximize leverage and efficiency.

**Addressing the elephant in the room:**

* **Time to close:** There are plenty of horror stories about SBA loans dragging on for months before closing. That’s why it’s essential to work with a lender who has a proven track record in the industry.  My personal average closing time for owner-occupied CRE deals—whether SBA 504 or 7(a)—is 60 days. As a direct lender, I fund both the bank and 504 portions at closing to streamline the process and shorten the timeline. Additionally, with $120M+ in SBA 7(a) loans closed since 2019, I'm able to navigate the changing program landscapes and increase efficiencies to a deal team.  Working with the right lender makes all the difference in getting deals closed smoothly and on time."

7afee049-e779-46fd-90c3-6919340ec678,Entrepreneur,"My first startup failed, but it was exactly what I needed to get to where I am today. Here's what happened: 

I made the classic first-time founder mistake - I built a vitamin instead of a painkiller. I spent too much time building and not nearly enough time talking to customers.

**But failing taught me the most valuable lessons:**

* Always validate ideas before building anything
* Sell before building
* Solving urgent problems people will pay for
* Always, always, be talking to customers, right from day 1

One of my biggest learnings came from struggling with cold outreach. I noticed that the only customers we landed were the ones already searching for what we offered. I wasn’t convincing anyone, just finding the right people at the right time. Every day, I spent hours scouring the internet for these conversations.

After talking to other founders, I realized this wasn’t just my problem - it was a universal pain point. Cold outreach is brutal, often converting at less than 1%. What founders really need isn’t just more outreach, it’s a way to reach customers the moment they’re ready to buy.

That's how I came up with the idea for my new startup. I realized there’s a massive opportunity to help businesses find customers at the perfect moment by using AI to monitor online platforms. And since I started working on this, the interest I’ve been getting from customers has been insane - it’s a crazy experience to (finally!) be solving an urgent problem. 

So to my fellow founders: failure isn't the end, it’s just part of the process. Every lesson, every misstep, and every pivot makes you stronger. The only way you truly fail is if you stop trying. Sometimes you need to build the wrong thing first to learn how to build the right thing. Keep going! "

162fea39-a0a3-47b7-8e0f-95fd95c3fd6b,Entrepreneur,"Nonprofit disability liaison group

Hey so I have an idea for a nonprofit organization but idk if it’s a useful idea or if it’s something that exists. I’ve spent a lot of my life working with kids with special needs and now I’m actually finishing my internship/degree to become a school psychologist. I’ve started learning a lot about special ed law and resources and because of that my social media feed has been hit with a lot of news about the current administration and different attacks on disability rights. It’s frustrating but it’s made me take more of an interest in advocacy and I came up with a potential idea for a nonprofit. 

What would this nonprofit provide

-direct people to different resources through a disability liaison, for example if there is a parent who just found out their child has autism and is curious about different therapies and their pro’s and con’s, these liaisons would be knowledgeable enough to inform them what these therapies are and help the parent decide if they could be a good fit for them then connect them to services within the community.

-liaisons could also help connect parents or individuals to potential jobs that are available so they can work.

-connect them to specific law groups if civil rights are potentially being violated.

-advocate and inform parents and individuals on civil rights issues involving the different disability communities to help them stay informed and aware of what is going on in the country when it effects them. 

-inform parents/individuals of rights they have in the home or the schools and what in school services they should seek out. 

These liaisons could be hired social workers or others from related fields such as school psychs etc.

I’ve seen these services offered separately but I can’t seem to find any that include them all in one company. Also many of these companies only cover specific disabilities. For example, I found one that calls itself an advocacy group but after reading reviews, it was only individuals with autism/mental handicaps and only provided law advice. The reviewer had anxiety and ptsd and was told they couldn’t help him. The organization I’m thinking of could be split into different departments covering different disabilities and helping to provide this info to more than just one group. 

I’m not sure of all of this yet and I’m still not sure if this has already been done or if it’s a dumb idea. I also feel like it isn’t a fully formed idea yet. Any thoughts?

Hey everyone,

This feels crazy. Right now, I feel kind of sad, and I don’t even know why…

Here’s the story:

After years of trying different services like graphic design, SEO, Google Ads, copywriting, and more — I finally found a product I’m truly passionate about and can scale effectively.

I was always chasing that entrepreneur feeling, but it never really clicked. I never had much money, always barely getting by. Sometimes I had a little extra to live, not just to survive — but that was rare.

Now, I’ve discovered something that works: optimizing Google Business Profiles. It’s affordable for clients, has a big impact, and — unlike SEO services — doesn’t come with endless explanations about competition and timeframes.

For the first time, I feel relieved and excited. I’m collecting micro-clients who don’t drain my energy, and the marketing is finally running well (after trying everything—paid ads, referrals,... you name it). 

And the best part? My clients are kind.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. It feels weird. I was always searching for that one product — the one thing that felt right.

Now I’ve found it. And honestly? This feeling is strange.

I’ve always looked at other entrepreneurs and seen their one thing. 
Now, I think I’ve found mine. By accident. 

After trying every online business model imaginable — ecom, writing, marketing — all of it. It always felt like a struggle, like I had to constantly convince new clients of their own needs.

But this? This works. And I’m both: confused and happy at the same time.

I guess I just needed to put this out there. No one around me really understands these entrepreneur feelings, so… yeah.

Thanks for reading.



------- ORIGINAL TEXT:

Hey everyone!
It‘s crazy. And atm I feel sad. And I don‘t know why… the story:

I’ve finally found a product I’m truly passionate about and can scale effectively. 

After years and years of trying different services like graphic design, SEO, Google Ads, copywriting, and more, I struggled to find something that felt right. 

I mean. I never had money. Almost broke eveytime, some times more money to live and not just survive. You know that „entrepreneur“ thing I always wanted (It never felt like that)

…But now, I’ve discovered optimizing Google Business Profiles as a product, which is affordable for clients and has a big impact. 
It doesnt sound like a big „thing“ or so, but I always struggled with these SEO clients who paid an OK amount but never really understood that it took time and that the competition is always very hard. 

I feel relieved and excited, like I’ve finally found my place as an entrepreneur. I just wanted to share this journey with you all.

Because it works! I am collecting micro clients which don‘t bother me too much for their small amounts which they pay. 

It feels right now, the marketing runs well (finally after trying paid ads, recommendations and so on) and my clients are very kind. 

Don‘t know why I am writing this. It feeld weird. I was always on the run to find „that“ or „my“ product. Just this ONE product. 

Now I got it. And this feeling is weird, I can‘t describe. When I look to all them entrepreneurs I always see their „one“ thing. 

I think this is mine. Found it on a coincidence… and it was a wild ride after I really tried EVERY online thing you can do (much more than you read above… I mean, ecom, writing, marketing… all that stuff which felt very very hard I knew that I can‘t always persuade any new customer for all the need they have). 

yes. That‘s it. it feels new and… I am confused. But happy at the same time. 

And I can‘t talk to someone cause no one can understand my feelings. my „entrepreneur“ feelings. 

yep. thanks for reading. "

c80ebbd1-ea72-4dc9-b13f-63226865a287,Entrepreneur,"Me, the teenage business guru.



If you want to start and successfully grow a business, listen to me, the great grandson of the online business guru. No, I'm not giving you a course to buy, I'm giving you real-world, non-theoretical, cold-hard, no-bulls#\*t advice to grow your business. Let's begin.



If you want to start a business, the first thing you can have is $0. For less than a cent, you can start a business, and with $0, you can't grow a business. I'm sorry if you were disappointed to hear but you came to me to get advice that'll actually save you time. Starting a business simply means to build a product or service for profit. Even if your product takes off, you'll use the profits to reinvest back into the business. That's why you can't scale without money, whether directly or indirectly. 



Now, if you don't have around $300, on the low end of the spectrum, to your name, and no financial aid, then you are not in the right place to grow your business. If you can't manage your time well, you aren't fit for business. If you can't juggle multiple projects under pressure, you are not built for business. If you don't have the resilience to go at something for at least a year, you are not fit for business. If you can't prioritize learning over immediate success, you are not fit for business. If you love instant gratification, you are not fit for business. If you can't discipline yourself, you are not fit for business. If you can't socialize, you are not fit for business. If you care about what others think, you are not fit for business. If you aren't willing to do your research and study, you are not fit for business. If you'd rather listen to gurus, like me, over actually implementing what you learn, you are not fit for business. If you can't set clear, concise goals, you are not fit for business. If you rather work harder than smarter, you are not fit for business. If you can't set daily goals and compete against yourself, you are not fit for business. If can't be delusional enough to think your product can take off... you are NOT fit for business.



It takes a certain amount of delusion and confidence to make your product succeed. You have to be willing to discipline yourself, network, market, delay gratification, and be determined and committed. Treat your venture as if it were your spouse. And again, if you don't believe you can make it and like to talk down yourself, you are not fit for business.



Alright, let's get to my actual points now that I've given you some foundation.



I'm going to ask you three questions, and if you can't answer, re-evaluate yourself.



1. If you had 10 businesses that failed, would you keep going?

2. Do you have any S.N.A.A.C.K.S?

3. Can you manage data?



Let's begin with the first question.



I don't give a s#!t about how fudging corny this is, but one of the greatest skills you can learn, is resilience. Resilience is a skill, not a quality. The ability to bounce back after 10 major failures that you gave your best for is amazing. I'm speaking from personal experience. I have had more than 10 failed projects that I kept going at for roughly the past 3 years, and yet, I've gotten a few benefits. One, those flops, at the very least, taught me what NOT to do when creating the next project. You need to mess yourself up, and make yourself addicted to the pain. Love and embrace the pain. It should be a dopamine rush. Two, if you have 4 or more failed ventures in a space, move on and shelve it until later. 



Something that keeps me going is passion. You are a car, your mindset is your engine, and passion is your fuel. If you don't like what you do, then do what you like. Don't listen to the s#!t offered by my competing gurus (I'm the Reddit guru so you know I'm original). Don't do what just seems lucrative to you. Do something you like that could be lucrative. For me, it was writing, coding, game design, and graphic design.



S.N.A.A.C.K.S



S - Skillset



N - Network



A - Awareness



A - Automation



C - Capital



K - Knowledge



S - Strength



This is pretty much self-explanatory. Don't start a business if you don't have skills. There are 3 core skills you should have- content creation, sales, and the main skill required for going into the space you've chosen. When I was younger, I thought I'd become a bestselling author with my first ever graphic novel. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was just learning how to make my writing more engaging and error-prone, and I was learning how to use Adobe Illustrator so I could create illustrations for the book. I expanded it into a series of books and even a promotion spinoff series on Global Comix, but it still flopped and my neighbors and their friends were the only buyers.



As for network, come on. Network. Socialize both online- joining online communities/forums- and offline- the people around you and the people they know. As much as it was a flop, my first book made $15 in profit because I knew people. You think if I was a go-hard introvert who lived alone in the outskirts of my city with no social media presence, I would have sold around 5 copies of it? Ha!



Awareness is content creation. Think of Mr. Beast. I bet the keyboard I'm typing this on that he could launch his own Mario Kart rip-off tomorrow and it would sell better than hotcakes. That's because he has generated heaps of attention and positive perception online. Of course, he could sell anything just by mentioning it on his channel.



Automate where ever you can. Don't be stupid and ask AI to generate every single thing you write. That's idiocy in its prime. But, you can use AI to brainstorm. If you find a good collaborator, collaborate. Actively seek partners and good advice (like mine) and implement them. While statistics show that businesses with co-founders are more likely to succeed, it's better to go solo if you'll just be having a co-founder for the sake of having one.



Capital is pretty self-explanatory. For knowledge, do research on your industry, competitors, and the flops and successes in your space. As for strength, you should have a drive.



Your drive should be made up of two things: motivation/inspiration and a repeatable ""system"". This system could be setting goals and obstacles for the next day and competing against yourself to get through them and come out on top. Motivation alone won't get you anywhere.



Data Management:



Knowing how to use what you've learned from research is one of the key things to succeeding in business. Marketing agencies (like the ones I don't have) and companies like McDonald's or Apple (or the ones I'm trying to turn my businesses into) do this all the time. They collect data based on customer feedback, ad watch times, click-offs- you name it.



Three years and 10+ failed projects later, I'm still here, launching yet another venture my siblings look down on. I'm building a card game and am using my research, knowledge, and experience from past projects to help it thrive, and am also prepared for it to flop. That's a mindset to develop, if you don't have it yet.



Concluding this post, here are a couple mantras for you:



""With $0, you can start a business. With $0, you can't grow a business.""



""If you lock in, you can have (almost) anything you want."" It's different grinding, where you just work hard, while you work smarter with the first with intense focus.



""It's better to adapt than stick one thing and fail repeatedly.""



""I don't like what I do if I don't wake up excited about it.""



""A buzzing mind is a powerful asset.""



Well, that's it. All the best to everyone! And be sure to buy my new online course on marketing- ha, I got you there! I'm not one of those gurus who teaches people how to become wealthy through paid, useless courses but became wealthy myself by selling those courses in the first place.

Long-time lurker here, finally taking the plunge into entrepreneurship. I've always had a corporate job, so stepping into this world feels both exciting and daunting.

I've been a fitness enthusiast for over 15 years, and one thing I’ve noticed is that people always ask me: ""What supplements do you take?"" I’ve seen so many struggle to find the right ones for their goals, so I want to build something that helps simplify this process.

My long-term vision is to create a platform that offers personalized supplement recommendations. But instead of diving in blindly, I want to validate the idea first. I set up a landing page with a health questionnaire to see if people engage with it.

My question: Is this the right approach to validate the idea? What other ways should I test before investing too much time/money? I'm super new to both entrepreneurship and online products, so any advice from the experienced folks here would be hugely appreciated.

622910f7-ad77-4cb8-a67b-05de760f9c19,Entrepreneur,"Hi guys, a few months back I posted about having too many ideas that I could start a business off of. 

Now I’m coming back to tell you that I have decided to start my own media hub. 

Basically, I have a lot of experience with digital paid media (especially meta ads) as a marketer. 

But I realized I can be superior vs other media hubs because I have a business-driven mindset & experience because of my 9-5 job (I work for a big corporation and was the mkt lead for this company’s “startup”).

This means that I can help businesses achieve their goals through paid media.

This may seem obvious to you, but as someone who’s been a client to these agencies/media hubs for a quite long time, let me tell you - it’s VERY hard to find an agency/media hub that can be strategic. 

Most will operate digital paid media to achieve the best looking KPIs, so when they present to you, everything is awesome, campaign is going crazy, lots of clicks, impressions, etc etc etc. And since you are not a specialist, you’ll believe it is working great.

But what they won’t tell you is that those numbers are actually vanity KPIs. 

Sure, they are pretty, big numbers. 
But they aren’t bringing you any kind of lift to your business.

My media hub comes to actually make an impact to businesses. 

If the campaign I’m making for you is achieving 500 clicks, I bet you these 500 clicks are QUALITY and actual interested people, and not bots or unqualified leads. Which is far more valuable than 5k empty clicks.

So that’s it. I’m pretty excited to finally have decided what I want to do from now on. 

And if you have a small/medium company and are in need of a specialist to help you acquire new customers or convert more, hit me up and let’s chat. I’m picking up Pro Bono jobs to create my portfolio and gather a few cases.

I hope you're doing well. M 23-year-old from India with an engineering background in electronics and computers. After working as a Business Development professional in digital asset management, I've decided to pursue my true passion: building an Ayurvedic healthcare brand.

I'm currently in the beta testing stage for a new venture that focuses on Ayurvedic multi-mineral and vitamin pills suitable for people of all genders and ages (16+). The idea is to offer a holistic, natural product to support overall well-being, and I am deeply committed to bringing this vision to life.

I'm looking for a like-minded co-founder, preferably from the West, to join me on this exciting journey. The role does not require any funding at this stage. I am in the process of testing the concept and finding a few dedicated people who are passionate about Ayurveda and holistic health. Your experience in the wellness or healthcare sectors would be an added bonus, but more than anything, I’m looking for someone who shares the same passion for this industry.

I will be working full-time on this project, alongside preparing for some personal examinations, so I am dedicated to pushing this venture forward.

If you’re interested or have any questions, feel free to reach out. I'm eager to connect and see if we’re a good fit for this journey.

I want to help him stay focused on what we can control while also being realistic about how the industry is evolving. How have you approached this with your team?

1. SEO isn’t dead, it’s just different. AI is shifting how we optimize, but human strategy is still needed to guide it.

2. Clients care about outcomes, not just tactics. Whether it’s SEO, paid ads, or content marketing, businesses will always need experts to drive growth.

3. Adaptability is key. The best way to future-proof a career is to evolve with the tools, not fear them.

Some say that inaction is what holds entrepreneurs back. 

Others say it’s fear. 

But I’m thinking it’s the nexus between the two. It’s not acting in spite of fear. 

There should always be an appropriate amount of fear. Irrational fear is definitely a killer. But if you’re not listening to the natural fear, then you’ll potentially risk too much. 

Entrepreneurs require courage. But that doesn’t mean the absence of fear. But if you don’t act, well the result is a given. 

This includes “action faking,” where because of fear, we pretend to take action by doing useless things (like read and watch videos about becoming an entrepreneur without actually doing anything). 

The solution? Acknowledge appropriate fear and take some real action in baby steps. 

Too cliche? Or useful?"

b4f56398-e978-478c-bbd4-4f7ac4031c4b,Entrepreneur,"Why Reddit Messaging Feels So Awkward.

Because they designed the messaging like a networking forum.

Reddit has one of the best-threaded conversation systems for discussions. It’s like a real-life event:

• Someone posts a topic (like the main event)

• People comment, and each comment creates its own mini-thread, like in real life when people break off into smaller groups at an event to talk about different things in a networking event.

This system is brilliant for discussions because it mimics how conversations happen in real life—people gather in circles, talk about various topics, and then move to another group.

But here’s the issue: Reddit copied this same system for private messaging, and it doesn’t feel natural.

💬 Why? Because messaging is meant to be linear. When you text someone, there’s just one thread where you talk about a subject. You might switch topics in the middle, but it is always one subject at a time.

This is exactly why when you reply to someone on WhatsApp, Instagram, or any other messaging platform, the replies show up after the last message. It’s easy to follow and it feels natural.

But Reddit does something different:

• Every reply creates a new thread.

• It’s like you’re having a private conversation with someone, but suddenly every reply feels like a new mini-conversation, without noticing you have 3 or 4 mini conversations that you have to have at the same time.

This works well for discussions where there is multiple people who can split into smaller groups, but it’s a poor fit for messaging. That’s why Reddit messaging feels off, it doesn’t follow the flow of a normal one-on-one conversation.

Great UX is about context. Reddit got it right for discussions but missed the mark for messaging.

Do you feel the same way about Reddit messaging? "

Quick question 

I am a seasoned marketing and e-commerce professional 

But I also started an agency side hustle 5 years ago. 

This has its ups and downs because I work full time and running the agency on the side. 

In the same time I started writing marketing & e-commerce content online to attract new customers. 

BUT, 

Accidentally I posted a few posts about my side hustle journey starting as a freelance after the 9-5 etc and my social profiles blew up ( I get something like 50 connection requests per day on LinkedIn. )

I really enjoy writing this kind of content as well 👌

So, now that I am growing so fast, I am thinking of monetising the account in the medium term. 

The products I am thinking of introducing are: 

1. A free consulting review for people who want to start a side hustle 
2. A personal branding guide for the same audience 
3. A guide on how to sell as you start from zero 
4. An accountability service where we set weekly meetings to check on progress and set next steps. 

What do you think of the above? 

Does it make sense to you? 

And what other services digital products would you try to sell in order to monetise such an audience?

d9add686-550b-415d-87b9-3eae8807f35c,Entrepreneur,"**Here's how they did it:**

**1.  Hiring their first creator & going viral**

On December 1st, they started experimenting with organic TikTok marketing and brought on their first creator to test initial formats. Within just 15 days their user base grew from 2,000 to 105,000 users through organic content.

Video #3 hit 10M views, and after that several other videos reached millions of views each.

**2. Scaling from 1 to 6 creators** 

They moved fast to use this momentum. One week after the start they:

* expanded their creator team to 6 members 
* reached 400,000 total downloads
* achieved consistent weekly growth of 40,000 downloads
* found their main audience was iOS users in the US despite working with non-US creators

The best part was they could drop their marketing costs.

Total spending went down to just $1,000 per week, making it 98% cheaper than traditional paid advertising.

**3. The content factory approach**

They completely changed how traditional influencer marketing worked.

Instead of:

* paying $2,000-$4,000 per influencer
* dealing with weeks of negotiations  
* setting high expectations for limited content
* losing 10-20% to agency fees

**They built a content factory with:**

* $20 base pay per video plus performance bonuses
* fast hiring of motivated creators 
*  high-volume content strategy with clear expectations
* direct creator relationships without middlemen
* Why faceless content works better than influencers

On TikTok and Instagram people care more about value than faces. Content without showing the creator that matches the current trend gets higher engagement. Apps can grow faster with this strategy since it's faster and cheaper to produce and publish these types of videos.

Videos that worked best for them: tutorials, results, tips, and before/after comparisons. Pure value content regularly hit millions of views.

**Does it work in any niche**

We have tried and helped implement this strategy for other apps which has worked really well in these other industries too:

* gaming app
* fitness app
* school app
* music labels
* esports tournament ($25K prize pool)
* casino app

The important part is finding affordable creators (usually students or small creators) who can make simple, consistent content. Each creator runs 3-5 accounts and posts 2-3 times per day. The content should be valuable and show the product in an natural way.

I started a D2C brand last year, and my background is in tech. As a lean team, we had to get creative with marketing, but I quickly realized how much time it takes, even with agencies and influencers involved.

A lot of tasks are repetitive — like analyzing competitor ads, gathering inspiration, and then creating the actual ad creatives.

After talking to about six marketing experts (ex. Head of marketing at Udaan, ex. Director of Unacademy), I’ve narrowed down these pain points:

1. Marketing teams rely on graphic designers and writers for collaterals, so tools to help create ads (videos, images) would be useful.
2. Competitive analysis is painful; a tool to track competitor activities would help a lot.
3. Using AI to run A/B tests, manage campaigns, and make quick adjustments could save tons of time.

With AI changing how we work, I see huge potential in tools that can 100x marketers’ productivity — though I’m cautious about automating everything.

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to make a small post (mostly for myself but also for anyone who's hesitating to take the leap into following their dreams) recollecting and sharing with you my 10+ year process of stalling before pursuing my dream.

Around 2013/2014, I was failing my classes in college and I figured I would need to make money some way. I decided I would try and make and sell games (Lol I know. I was young and naive, and clearly not very smart haha). I had played a game at a friends house called capture the cat. I loved the simplicity of it, but it felt a bit too one sided. I slept on the game idea for a few nights and decided that this would be a really cool game to scale up for 1v1, 2v2, and free for all matches. Over time, the growth of the game never stopped, and we added different maps, cards and many cool things.

I made a prototype on my dad's chessboard, and had my first tester. Algerian dads are quite the tough critic, but he kept asking me for a quick round every day. And boy did he get good fast (I'm not sure I can consistently beat him anymore). We laughed, yelled and fought over the game. This convinced me I had something good in my hands. Knowing he was focused in the game and not in ""trying out something I made"" was a feeling of pride I had never felt before.

I tried making a digital copy of it in 2015, but sadly my developer moved to china and ghosted me. We were both quite young and life got in the way.

A few years went by, many life events happened, and the idea got put on the back burner. In 2022 I got laid off and had about a years worth of unemployment to sustain myself with. I realized that this would be the one time in life where I had no obligations, and had time to dedicate to this project.

Quickly, a team ended up shaping itself (4 extremely talented people), and we got to work. I had originally wanted to create a hard copy of my game, had started with the negotiations with factories, but sadly the upfront cost for the quality we wanted was just too much for me to bare given the unemployment. It would also mean putting huge shipping costs on the client side and I wasn't comfortable with that. We decided to opt for a digital version, and hopefully have that supplement a higher quality hard copy version.

All of this to say, if you have a board game in mind, and you've been wanting to create it, then go for it. It'll be hard, but it'll be worth it. Maybe not financially, but I promise you, you will never regret having tried.

To those of you interested in helping us do QA, joining our Coop and PVP nights, I would love to give you early access to our game. 

I will also hold discussions explaining marketing results weve had In the digital and mobile real. "

53b0dd16-7f00-4dd9-86af-08541a88ae5e,Entrepreneur,"Hey there, its Ren again.

Anything exciting lately?

Wish you all luck with it.

Hey, thanks for waiting for me these couple of days, the posting delay will never happen again 😉 (maybe)

So as the title says, 

Here's **How to make people fall into the buying rabit hole.**

First, you need to know your audience, who they are, how do they talk, what content do they watch, are they single or married, any kids yet? Etc, etc...

And you need to know where are they coming from, which source of traffic brought them to your landing page? FB ads, SEO, Google ads, your email list, organic content, word of mouth, Google maps, referrals? Etc, etc...

Now, once you find out who they are and what brought them to your landing page, you can start now using our psychological trigger of the day.

**Commitment.**

Technically speaking it means to make people take a series of micro actions, so once they see your big request they say ""alright, FCK it, we've already made it this far and what's the worse that's gonna happen anyway.""

Remeber the game blue whale?

It pretty much operated using the exact principal, it asked for small commitments then progressively increased the requests from the user, untill they reached the ""FCK it"" point and....

Anyway, that ""FCK it let's do it"" point, my dear friend, is what we all need our prospects to say before engaging in putting the money in our pockets.

Now, enough with the theoretical yapping, let's give some examples of how to use commitment.

1 **Use Surveys** between the traffic source and the landing page. 

And make **Physical 101 Surveys** too, they are very powerful, because think about it, 

if you're prospect stops in the middle of the street, stays with you for 5 minutes answering your questions about his personal life,
 
wouldn't that be a heck of a commitment from him?

And what makes the 101 better is that it's not overused these days, most of us now are either introverted or completely forgot that physical intraction still print money.

Just get your dialogue script memorized, 

Go to the streets and start searching for your ICP and once you find him ask him politely to answer your survey following the script you memorized. (Note that this isn't scalable, unless you created a survey team)

2 **Micro Commitments:** if your service requires them to provide personal information, 

Snuggle some very personal requests here and there, for example ask for a photo,

Ask for when did they got married (don't forget to give the choice of I'm not married in the drop down) 

Get them to sign up for your free program and actually benefit from it, 

Get them to consume your content daily,

Get them to open your emails and actually benefit from them, 

Make them show up to your work place if you're a physical 101 service and have an office,

Get them to order a free lead magnet (ask for credit card but keep it free)

Get them to sign up for a free trial and give them an unforgettable experience,

Get them to take a Free examination for their teeth,

Get them buy a micro offer (anything bellow $10)

**The Possibilities Are Endless...**

But the trick is to be creative and make those steps seamless and frictionless as possible,

Because people nowadays are very sensitive and extremely used to most of these tricks, and will immediately know where this process is going. 

Be creative and find your own unique ways to ask for commitments.

The more clicks, the deeper they go into the rabit hole.


That's it for the day.

Thank you for being a great listener. 😉

See you tomorrow.

Ren 
The Psychology of Conversion Copywriter.


**P.S.** By the way, I forgot to mention verbal commitment, for example in your survey ask them to confirm verbally either by saying it 101, or just record it inside the servey.

The more effort they make without being pissed off, the better.

a800ec44-1385-449e-9f36-0ade4a3b942a,Entrepreneur,"Hello Reddit,

I am a 17 year old entrepenour from Sweden. I have forced myself into an event that will take place next week in Stockholm where I will have full backstage access where my ”job” is to guide these people up to the stage to talk. This is a huge opportunity to meet and connect with people who I have looked up to for years. International billionaires, politicians, ”celebrities” and the people who are the best at doing what they’re doing.

How do I make a connection with these people. They are here to work, they don’t care about me, I am not SUPPOSED TO give out my name, and I have to be professional. They won’t give out phone numbers or email addresses to anyone just because and I probably won’t have too much time to talk. I’m guessing that some people I will only be able to give a handshake to while some I will have a couple of minutes to chat with.

How do I make the most out of this opportunity?

I will be there with the main purpose of connecting with them with the upside of listening to some great talks.

Thank you, // Sebastian

Edit (idea):
I could change my background image on my phone to a short message and contact info for me that they can do whatever they want with. It’s pretty creative and memorable, right? Maybe even have a different background for each person I’m expecting to meet so it’s more unique for them."
0528d94b-6a01-480b-b4bd-e9bb2b08a731,Entrepreneur,"I recently embarked on a project with Voiceflow, determined to build a chat agent that was more than just a series of automated responses. My client needed an engaging tool for handling customer queries, so I gathered all the information they provided and started designing a flow that was both functional and user-friendly. I carefully mapped out the dialogues and wove in a bit of personality—my main goal was to create interactions that felt natural and helpful. Before long, a simple idea evolved into a fully-fledged chat agent that could actually connect with people.

Once the chat agent launched, the client was extremely pleased, and I received $300 for my work. It was a clear, tangible reward that proved the effort had been worthwhile. This experience showed me that combining the right tools with creativity can transform a straightforward assignment into something far more meaningful and profitable. Now, whenever I see the chat agent in action, I’m reminded of how important it is to trust the process and keep refining each step until it truly serves its users."

It took me about 3-4 months to make my first money and let me say that it was definitely worth it. I began with 0. I contacted maybe 10’s or 100’s of individuals and investors on linked in, asking for a investment into buying a run down property. That investment was for £125k and it was for a 2 bedroom house located in Manchester (England) which desperately needed some work doing to it. I painted walls, stripped walls, fixed holes, rearranged tables, putting down carpet you name it, I have most likely done it (if not in the first place but in the places afterwards) (using an extra £50,000 from another investor). That building is now worth £225,000, has a tenant renting it, and it currently makes me £1085 after all bills (£1250 before.) then I refinanced the property, paid back the 2 investors £185,000) (£175,000+interest)

That was 2 years ago, and now I currently do the same but with my own money, to apartment complexes. And I have recently started buying failing businesses and fixing them up. 

From making £0 on the verge of homelessness to £132,000 monthly (after all bills)

fe9f3978-f230-420d-8202-8dce01004dc2,Entrepreneur,"I've been working on a social networking site for self improvement and entrepreneurship. I know it's not original, and it's a very niche market, but it costs me next to nothing so why not give it a shot is my mentality.

My main concern is the engine of growth. Typically, you want each user to share to an average of 1 more user for consistent growth, or that's how I understand it anyway. I think this will be difficult as the main premise of the site is for other people interested in self improvement to network since it's likely very hard to meet other like-minded people in that niche, thus the average user most likely won't have anyone to share it to. Not only that, but my profits will be minimal as I will only earn from site ads and on-site transactions via the freelance work section.

So, what do you think, how can I get initial users onto the platform so I can learn what they want and improve the site as such?

Note: I've heard it before, it's an unoriginal concept. I'd like to clarify: I like to think that the site differentiates itself enough in that it's not a ""limited"" or ""exclusive"" community, it's for everyone and costs nothing, and it isn't there for me to sell some courses or charge fees, it's there for users to interact and benefit on their own, without my involvement, which I don't believe exists elsewhere.

Thanks in advance!"

How much to charge and should I even charge for an MVP? How do I proceed? Prospect didn't state a figure.

Monetize your wedding.

Weddings are expensive, and heck, 50% of them are basically afterthoughts ( if u know what I mean). This age old tradition shouldn’t put you in a hole, so here’s a way out! 

What if, you could allow a sponsor or a company  to essentially sponsor your wedding? They could have small ad placements like on the decorations or the heck the cake lol, but it could be done in a cool and kinda ironic way that isn’t cringey, I’m sure those details can be worked out. Maybe on the invitationals haha.

It’s a good advertising event for a company, hundreds of people go to a wedding and can be impressions.

Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to ask this but I am hoping you guys can help me out. My buddy has offered to sell me a % of his business. The business is in waste management and has been in business for about 9 years now.

How would you value this business to sell a percentage? My initial thought process was 2-3x of the annual Profits so roughly $690,000 -$1,035,000

7d592ac1-e7b0-479c-9112-3cd7ea6d2ae2,Entrepreneur,"Hi ,
A while back, I realized something—a lot of people struggle with keeping conversations going on dating apps. Messages either feel too generic (“Hey, how’s it going?”) or awkward, and convos fizzle out fast. I figured there had to be a better way to help people navigate online dating, so I started working on FlirtOS—a tool designed to help people craft more natural, engaging responses.
What I thought would be a simple idea turned out to be way more challenging than expected.
Some unexpected hurdles I ran into:
🔥 Making AI responses feel human. People don’t want generic, robotic messages—they want something that actually sounds like them.
🔥 Changing the mindset around messaging help. A lot of users feel like using a tool means they’re ""cheating,"" even though it’s just about improving conversation skills.
🔥 Getting people to stick around. Many users just want a quick fix. Keeping them engaged beyond the first few messages was tougher than I thought.
What I’ve learned so far:
✔ People don’t want a script—they want inspiration. Giving them structure without making it feel artificial is key.
✔ Marketing is about confidence, not just results. Users want to feel more comfortable talking to matches, not just get more replies.
✔ Simplicity wins. The less effort users have to put in, the more they engage.
Would love to hear from others—if you’ve built a product that helps people improve social or online interactions, how did you handle adoption and retention? Any insights or lessons you’ve learned?
Looking forward to your thoughts!"

# Essential Questions to Ask

1. **Who's your ideal customer?** Define your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) with laser precision.
2. **Where do your leads come from?** Scrutinize sources and processes to ensure quality.
3. **How do you qualify leads?** Understand the criteria used to separate hot prospects from time-wasters.
4. **What's your nurturing process?** Lead gen doesn't end at capture - it's about guiding prospects through the funnel.
5. **Can you scale?** Ensure your partner can handle growth spurts without compromising quality.

# Key Points to Remember

1. **Quality trumps quantity.** Focus on leads that convert, not just filling your pipeline.
2. **Personalization is king.** Tailor your approach to individual prospect needs.
3. **Content is your secret weapon.** Use webinars, case studies, and thought leadership to attract and engage.
4. **Leverage LinkedIn.** It's a goldmine for B2B targeting - use it wisely.
5. **Optimize your website.** It's often the first touchpoint - make it count with clear CTAs and value propositions.

ff0728a6-c2dd-47b2-9f8f-b5d1352a8847,Entrepreneur,"When it comes to building a profitable creator business, willpower often gets too much credit. It's like a matchstick trying to keep a campfire going—it eventually burns out. Relying solely on willpower has let me down countless times. There's no backup plan for those days when you're just ""off.""

As creators, the common advice is to push through it: keep posting, join more platforms, and just do more. But what if you can't? Or simply don’t want to?

Here's a fresh perspective on how to maintain momentum without burning out: focus on the highest return on your time. Below are three core systems that can revolutionize how you work:

1) **Leveraged Audience Growth**

Forget about trying to go viral on social media. The aim here is to form genuine partnerships and create win/win/win scenarios for everyone involved. You can grow a high-quality audience with just 20 minutes of effort a month.

2) **Leveraged Monetization**

Why wait for sales to happen by chance? We advocate for immediate action with Get Paid Now Funnels. These funnels allow you to monetize while expanding your audience base, ensuring that today’s efforts convert into today’s gains.

3) **Leveraged Conversions**

If daily sales are your goal, you need to ask for sales daily. The good news? You don't have to double your workload. Instead, invest your time upfront to build systems that work for you on a daily, weekly, and even annual basis.

Consider implementing these systems to regain control of your time while maximizing your business's profitability. It's about working smarter, not harder.

We're all trying to live our best lives and many of us try to leverage technology to become better faster and easier.

I’m building a company that builds an AI-native solution for self-improvement.

My thesis is that AI is an incredibly powerful tool for solving problems, particularly in programming and generally life - but ChatGPT isn't really designed to be your long-term 'coach'. It's great for handling specific tasks, answering questions, doing research, etc. - but it's memory and UX isn't optimized around things like behavior change, mental health support, and long-term personal life planning

I believe my core problems (which I think are shared by many) are:

1. Staying motivated - it's easy to lose motivation when progress isn't immediately apparent, there are setbacks, etc.
2. Self-doubt - it makes me question myself and waste time wondering if I'm the right person to be doing this, if the idea is too broad, etc. Some of this is good - but a lot of it just makes me less effective
3. Staying on Track - I start a thing, but then gradually pivot a million different directions. This may be a touch of ADHD. I find that I'll have a long-term goal (e.g. launching a successful business), but I'll tend to wonder a lot in the process of executing over weeks and months. Staying on track just feels suprisingly difficult. I do create TODO lists and have a Kanban board

I’m considering a bunch of features and have built a version focused more specifically towards mental health which implements a few:

• **Guided Journaling**

Guided journaling prompts to facilitate deeper reflection

• **Specialist AI Coaches**

Personalized, expert AI coaching for your specific area of focus and goals

• **Behavior Change & Habit Formation**

Leverage the science of behavior change to help you make lasting changes in your life

Hey everyone, 
I’m working on a healthy snack subscription service targeted at those desiring a more convenient approach to nutritious snacking whether due to busy lives, traveling, accessibility issues, or just because all while supporting their individual diet. The idea is to curate diet-friendly snack boxes(high-protein, keto, vegan, etc.) and deliver them directly to customers.
As well as those who want healthier alternatives to the junk food and treats they’re currently eating.

I’d love honest feedback from experienced entrepreneurs, especially on:

-strategies to reduce churn considering it’s a subscription service 

-and advice on working with distributors like UNFI or Faire

I know food businesses can be tricky, and I’m open to any insights that could save me from common mistakes. If you’ve built a subscription based business or worked in consumer packaged goods, I’d especially love to hear your thoughts.

I have been writing in-depth research documents for almost three years, primarily through my involvement in Model United Nations (MUN). My reports usually start at 25 to 30 pages minimum, following strict formatting standards with well-cited, authentic sources. Most of my research focuses on geopolitics, world affairs, and human rights violations, but I can create a well-structured, high-quality research document on virtually any topic.

Right now, I have way too much free time, so if paid well, I can complete a report in under 24 hours while maintaining high quality.

I want to use these skills to start earning but am unsure where to begin. Upwork feels too restrictive with limited free applications, Fiverr seems oversaturated, and I don’t know what other platforms might work.

My Questions:

1. What platforms or websites are best for offering research document services?
2. Are there specific niches or industries that pay well for this type of work?
3. How should I price my services as someone starting out?
4. With AI tools becoming so common, are people still willing to pay for well-researched, human-written reports?
5. Any tips on reaching clients directly without relying on big freelance marketplaces?
6. How do I showcase my portfolio? Should I just share one of my research documents, or is there a better way to present my work?

I’d appreciate any advice from those with experience in research writing, freelance work, or related fields. Thanks in advance!"

Or are the barriers to entry so low or the need so fleeting that these businesses are here today and gone tomorrow?  

Yet there are businesses that can last for the ages.  Where the effort to MVP or first revenue may be measured in years, and the need can be expected to last for decades.  Among well known tech companies, the space companies come to mind with their rocket plans coming to fruition only a decade or more after founding. But also small companies, some multi-generational that may offer a valuable specialty product or service which serves customers or an industry and supports a team for decades.  Yet these companies may hardly fill an impatient founder's or investor's desire for fast revenue growth or profitability.

For about a month, I've been researching some lesser-known tips that clothing brand owners used to boost their startup brands. As a result, I found these 3 key things that this particular brand (known as A Bathing Ape or BAPE for short) used in the 90s & 2000s their come-up to blow up as a business.

""1) Establish Connections: It’s not what you know; it’s who you know. You may be the jack of all trades, but the most successful artists all have established connections. Bape knew this and established connections early with some of Japan’s most influential designers. As BAPE grew, the business went on to build connections overseas with musicians like Kanye, Pharrell Williams, Lil Wayne, & even the late Biggie Smalls.

2) Promote yourself Creatively: You may have the best product in the world, but if nobody knows about it, then you cannot expect it to sell. Bape made sure to get his brand’s name out by giving out free t-shirts to Tokyo’s residents and then to famous musicians in Japan and then to overseas music artists as well. This made sure to spread awareness about BAPE during its heyday.

3) Take Risks & Prosper: If you are going to succeed in whatever creative endeavour you delve into, you must take risks. Bape did this by entering a foreign market, the United States. BAPE enjoyed success in Japan, and the business could’ve settled there and not expanded, but they chose not to. Because of their ability to take risks, BAPE enjoyed one of its best eras in its history.""

These tips are not just applicable to clothing brand owners, but also aspiring entrepenuers too. Hope these tips are somewhat useful to you!"

***They create networks of 50-100 branded accounts to grow their business:***

**Cal AI ($1M+ MRR, 600k downloads)**

* Makes 80 different TikTok accounts
* Posts diet tips and before/after videos
* Pays students to make content

**Turbolearn ($80k MRR, 80k downloads)**

* Makes 60 different TikTok accounts
* Posts study tips and school advice
* Gets students to create content for them

**Plug AI and Bible Chat ($300k MRR combined)**

* Both use 70-100 accounts each
* Post niche content like dating tips or Bible verses
* Work with small creators in their field

This strategy works because you can test many types of content at once, keep your accounts safe from bans, and spend less money than running ads. Plus, it's easy to scale once you find what works.

I've tried and helped implement this strategy for other apps which has worked really well. The important part is finding affordable creators (usually students or small creators) who can make simple, consistent content. Each creator runs 3-5 accounts and posts 2-3 times per day. The content should be 70% helpful tips, 30% showing your product.

The best part is you can start small. Test with 5 accounts first, see what content works, then scale up with more creators once you find what your audience likes."

Throughout high school I've had thoughts of doing whatever I wanted financially, but they would come and go. I came out of highschool with the idea that I'd be an electrician, get my license, and own my own business one day, and make a fine living, expecting a couple hundred thousand dollars a year. But every single day for the past year I've been thinking about being able to retire my parents, traveling wherever I want, when I want, blessing my closest friends with the fruits of weath, and just being extra ordinarily financially free. I've been doing constant research, reading books, disciplining myself, and filling my extra time with trying to become a millionaire in my 20's. I'm still an electrician now, but I don't have any amazing business ideas to start, but what I have learned is that I am young, and I need to build skills now to use so I can become successful in my venture. So i've come to the conclusion to master sales as my first skill. I am obsessed with the idea of sales as it's basically the closest thing you can get to being your own boss, as your income is directly effected by your efforts, and the sky is the limit. With sales I learn arguably the most important sales skill, and I can earn as much money as I can to invest into assets. As of right now i'm trying to figure out what sales I should get into to achieve the knowledge and the high returns to build a good base for myself. And I guess that's really where I'm at right now, and so don't just want to stop at a sales job. I am serious about making millions in my 20's and I am determined and ready to grind to death. I need some advice from people who understand the journey I'm in, and help me by providing ideas to allow me to better shape my future. Thank you. 

Edit: I have realized that most people are going to tell me to stick to the trade, but I have found from my own experiences that I want to get to where I want to be through communication, through persuasion, through building connections, basically through my mouth and mind, not my hands."

I wanted to share some interesting insights that might help those of you planning your next venture or looking to pivot your current business.

Here are the five industries projected to see significant growth in 2025 based on our data:

1. **Wind Turbine Technicians** The renewable energy sector is booming, with wind tech jobs projected to grow 60% through 2033. While most techs work for energy companies, there's a growing opportunity for independent contractors. Fair warning though, you'll need to be comfortable with heights as those tower ladders are usually at least 200 feet high!
2. **Solar Panel Installation** The solar industry is absolutely exploding, with projections showing growth to 500,000–1,500,000 workers by 2035. What's particularly interesting is that existing contractors (especially electricians and roofers) can transition into this field with minimal additional training.
3. **Nurse Practitioners** There's an interesting shift in the nursing space. While this segment has traditionally worked in hospitals, we're seeing a growing trend of nurse practitioners working as independent contractors through gig platforms to address worker shortages. There's currently a shortage of about 78,610 full-time registered nurses projected for 2025.
4. **Home Healthcare Workers** With an aging population and strained healthcare system, home healthcare is seeing massive growth - projected at 21% through 2033. The barrier to entry is relatively low, typically requiring just a high school diploma or equivalent to start, though specific requirements vary by state.
5. **Mental Health Counseling** With decreasing stigma around seeking treatment and increasing uncertainty in people's lives, mental health counseling is projected to grow 19% through 2033. There's lots of variety here, from working as a contractor in facilities to having your own practice.

What makes these particularly attractive for entrepreneurs is that they address fundamental societal needs that aren't going away anytime soon. While some require more extensive training than others, they all offer paths to either independent contracting or starting your own business.

One interesting trend I've noticed is how these industries are increasingly interconnected. For example, home healthcare workers often collaborate with nurse practitioners, and mental health counseling is becoming an important component of comprehensive healthcare services.

What are your thoughts on these growth areas? Are you currently working in any of these fields, or considering making a career switch? I'd love to hear about your experiences and perspectives.

I have made my share of compromises and short-givings to know that it is not about recognition, money, competition, or even happiness—though collective success will not be without them.

Certainty is a matter of connection and an openness to boundless inquiry, for me; anything else stems from fear, and control, that often leads to wasted efforts and resources. It is not a question of substance over form—without substance, form is meaningless, but without form, substance still retains its meaning.

While my technical skills are limited, they are versatile, adaptable and open to expansion as needed. What I have come to, over the past decade or so, is not a skill but a capacity—the ability to harness genuine inspiration and uproot bias. Along the way, I foresee this capacity transpiring among collaborators, giving a whole different quality to exponential growth—one that is sometimes measurable but often beyond quantification.

It is essential to emphasize that our task is not only to refine the ideas and the work we undertake but, more importantly, to refine ourselves and simultaneously, our relationships—since everything flows through and returns to this process. This is not an idealistic notion; it is simply the most logically efficient approach… A truly holistic solution does not require grasping the whole—prioritizing self-purification naturally leads us there. In fact, it brings forth the very substance emphasized in this text, with form arising as its inseparable byproduct.

What would be the kind of side hustle or activity I could do in a place like this to make a good amount of money. People who want a work that is smt extra to the normal 9-5 or that want a good side hustle do things like mountain guide, music perform in hotels (like 2h at dinner or smt), and not the more normal or simplier stuff like in other places for example cleaning trash bins, cleaning car interiors, cutting grass, rooftop jobs and so on.

What secure and easy payment methods would you implement if dealing with similar dollar values (below). We are building directly for the end user as well, not any type of dealerships, so ease of payment is very important, but also security and protecting the money on my end is top of mind. 

For reference, the lowest ticket item is in the neighborhood of $9,000. As people build out the hulls and package trailer and outboard together, we are looking at $25,000 to $40,000 builds. Deposits start around $5,000 and run up to $15,000 depending on the build. 

Thanks!"

On the other hand, when I attended college, it felt like I just wanted to get work over with so I could focus on my business (but I didn't have enough energy to make it successful until I dropped out)

Also, as a businessman, I want to cut costs where I can. College is ridiculously expensive for what you get. Not even a guaranteed job.

Having to attend lectures when I could read it all if they just wrote it down pisses me off. Such an inefficient way to learn"

Your time is valuable so I’ll keep this short and sweet! 

I would like to get all of your advices on how to go best about acquiring a nearby sushi restaurant. 

I’ve been to this place many times before. The place is clean and sushi is good. 
It’s rated well on google and every time we went there, we were not alone. 

What I know about the business:
 I found a sale listing of this restaurant a few months back, almost a year ago for $300,000 
I checked back today and the price was reduced to $250,000

Annual Gross revenue advertised is $500,000 

Rent: $5000/month

Number of employees: 5 (I usually see 3 people at most shifts)

Reason for selling: retiring owner



I need your advice on: 
1- How to approach the seller for more information about the business?
2- What questions and numbers to ask for?
3- How to pitch them the idea of seller’s financing? (I’m assuming it would be a not bad deal for retirement?)
4- How to get SBA loans? (I can barely scrap 10% down payment)

Some business etiquette along the way is appreciated.
Thank you all!"
bc64ea1c-05fa-44ca-abcc-754dd9a3a8b4,Entrepreneur,"For years, I launched products, hoping one would take off. I followed all the standard advice, setting up landing pages, running ads, and cold messaging potential users. Nothing stuck the way I wanted.

Everything changed when I stopped trying to force growth and started building within a community. Instead of chasing users, I listened to them. That shift led to a product that people actually wanted and were willing to pay for.

The biggest lessons came from real interactions. I started sharing my process, asking for feedback, and making early users feel like part of the development journey. The product evolved based on their needs, not just my assumptions.

Instead of offering a free tool and hoping for conversions later, I tested pricing early. Real validation came when people were willing to pay for what I built. Word-of-mouth became the best form of marketing. Satisfied users shared their experiences, and the product spread naturally.

Now, there’s a growing base of paying subscribers and a clear path forward. It’s not about chasing the next big idea anymore. It’s about refining what works, serving a community, and making sure the product continues solving real problems.

If you’re trying to grow a SaaS, focus on the people who would use it. Engage with them directly, build what they need, and make them part of the process. The best marketing is a great product that people want to talk about."

e9dca458-e5e2-458e-bd6d-d2ad37d7d87e,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been in the trenches building web solutions for years, and one thing I keep hearing is: “My SaaS idea is going to be the next big thing!” Yet, most SaaS projects end up falling short. I’d like to break down why that happens, share some best practices for SaaS development, and offer tips on how to start strong—even if your initial product seems promising, there are pitfalls that can sink it.

# 1. Skipping Market Research & Validation

**The Issue:**  
Many founders dive into development without properly validating if there’s a real need for their solution. A great idea on paper doesn’t guarantee that customers will pay for it.

**Insight:**

* **Do your homework:** Engage with potential customers through surveys, interviews, and landing pages.
* **Test demand:** Run a pre-launch campaign or create a prototype to gauge interest before investing fully.

# 2. Misaligned Product-Market Fit

**The Issue:**  
Even if your product is solid, if it doesn’t solve a pressing problem or align with the target market’s needs, adoption will be slow.

**Insight:**

* **Define your audience:** Clearly identify who your users are and understand their pain points.
* **Iterate based on feedback:** Use customer feedback to refine your product continually.

# 3. Underestimating the Competition

**The Issue:**  
Failing to analyze the competitive landscape can leave you unprepared for rivals who already have market trust.

**Insight:**

* **Competitive analysis:** Identify direct and indirect competitors, and find your unique value proposition.
* **Differentiate:** Focus on what makes your solution unique—be it features, pricing, or customer support.

# 4. Financial Mismanagement & Resource Allocation

**The Issue:**  
SaaS projects are not “build and forget.” They require continuous investment—in development, infrastructure, marketing, and customer support.

**Insight:**

* **Plan your finances:** Understand your burn rate and ensure you have a sustainable business model.
* **Build incrementally:** Start with a lean MVP and scale as you gain traction and revenue.

# 5. Poor Onboarding & Customer Support

**The Issue:**  
A product that’s hard to use or lacks adequate support will lose users quickly, even if it’s feature-rich.

**Insight:**

* **Simplify onboarding:** Invest in creating clear tutorials, FAQs, and support channels.
* **Focus on customer success:** Proactively engage with users to help them realize the value of your product.

# 6. Technical Debt & Scalability Issues

**The Issue:**  
Initial shortcuts in development or underestimating scalability can lead to performance bottlenecks or even service outages as your user base grows.

**Insight:**

* **Plan for growth:** Build with scalability in mind from the start.
* **Invest in quality:** Regularly refactor and update your codebase to avoid technical debt.

# 7. Inadequate Marketing & Sales Strategy

**The Issue:**  
Even the best product can falter if no one knows about it. Relying solely on organic growth or word-of-mouth can limit your reach.

**Insight:**

* **Develop a go-to-market strategy:** Leverage content marketing, SEO, and paid channels to reach your audience.
* **Monitor metrics:** Track acquisition, engagement, and churn rates to continuously optimize your strategy.

# 8. Complacency After Initial Success

**The Issue:**  
It’s tempting to rest on your laurels once you see early traction. However, overconfidence can lead to neglecting customer feedback, market changes, or necessary pivots.

**Insight:**

* **Stay agile:** Continue iterating and updating your product.
* **Stay informed:** Keep an eye on market trends and competitor moves to ensure you’re not left behind.

# Why Even a “Winning” Product Might Fail

Even if you’ve built something that you believe is a winner, several hidden challenges can lead to its downfall:

* **Evolving Customer Needs:** Markets change rapidly. What works today might not work tomorrow if you’re not evolving.
* **Scaling Challenges:** As your user base grows, issues like performance, security, and support can become overwhelming if not planned for.
* **Neglected Marketing:** A product can only be as good as its ability to reach the right audience. A lackluster marketing strategy can stifle growth.
* **Failure to Innovate:** Continuous improvement is key. Relying solely on your initial vision without adapting can render your product obsolete.

# Final Thoughts & Call to Action

Building a successful SaaS isn’t just about having a great idea; it’s about execution, continuous learning, and adaptability. Whether you’re just starting out or already in the middle of your journey, understanding these pitfalls and best practices can save you time, money, and heartache.

If you’re at any stage in your SaaS journey and need guidance or a seasoned developer to help you navigate these challenges, feel free to reach out. I’ve spent significant years building robust web solutions, and I’d love to help you get started on your project. Let’s build something great together!"

Have a clear target audience.  


Can be improved or differentiated (I want to add my own twist!).

4e163110-1926-49ab-ba9d-bfc23d9c8a84,Entrepreneur,"Cold outreach isn’t failing because you don’t have the right tools. The real question isn’t whether you’re reaching the right people. It’s whether they actually need what you’re selling. AI Tools can automate the process, but they won’t sell product nobody wants.

So once again the question isn’t how you reach people – it’s why they should care. Do they actually need what you’re selling? Is your offer different enough? In old markets, where everyone sells the same thing, the only way to win is through discounts and price wars. In new markets, the challenge is even bigger. You have to educate people before they even realize they have a problem.

Finding the right people? Mostly solved. Messaging and delivery? Already optimized. What’s left? Market fit. If outreach isn’t working, your reply rate will tell you why. It’s the best indicator of whether you’re in the right market and if there’s a real chance to build a profitable business.

Cold outreach isn’t just about selling today – it’s about planting seeds for tomorrow. The tools will only work if the strategy is right.

I thought this would be the place to form strong connections, to network with people who were looking beyond the next night out. But after nearly two years, I feel more out of place than ever.

The library is filled with people talking about their next party. My lectures are full of students glued to TikTok, barely paying attention. I tried to ignore it, thinking maybe I was just looking in the wrong places. So I joined societies and sports clubs, hoping to meet people who showed up out of genuine interest, not just obligation. Maybe there, I’d finally find some depth. But again, I was wrong. Most people were just there to pad their CVs or to meet girls. Conversations felt shallow, forced—like people were just playing a game of appearances rather than genuinely wanting to connect.

I’ve tried. I’ve put myself out there. I’ve kept an open mind. But the more I try, the more I realize that the kind of people I’m looking for might not be here. And now, I’m seriously considering an apprenticeship instead—something that could give me real experience, real networking opportunities.

I’ve been brainstorming a business idea that could change how restaurants operate, and I’d love feedback from this community. Here's the concept:

Imagine an app that eliminates the need for waiters. Customers would download the app, browse the menu, place their orders (for dine-in or takeout), and pay directly through their phones. The app can be versatile, so if a particular restaurant wants to keep payment and specific aspects of the dining process physical, it's open to flexibility and preference.

# How It Works:

* **For Customers**: You won't have to wait for someone to take your order. Just scan a QR code at your table or open the app at home, pick your dishes, and customize your order. You’ll also get real-time updates like “Preparing” or “Ready for Pickup.”
* **For Restaurants**: Orders go straight to the kitchen via a centralized dashboard, reducing labor costs and human error.
* **After the Meal**: The app automatically follows up with customers, asking for feedback or reviews and potentially offering incentives like “10% off your next order.”

# Why It’s Different:

* Restaurants save money on staffing and improve operational efficiency.
* Customers enjoy a seamless, tech-driven experience without needing to flag down waitstaff.
* It also offers built-in upselling suggestions (like “Add garlic bread for $2!”) and loyalty programs.

# Monetization:

I’d charge restaurants a monthly subscription fee and maybe add a per-order commission model.

# My Questions:

1. Would restaurants adopt this, or would it feel like too much tech?
2. Would you use an app like this as a customer, or would you miss the human interaction?
3. Do you have any thoughts on must-have features that could make this better?

I’m just starting out, so I’d love to hear your ideas or constructive criticism!"

0a61bbfb-27e5-4655-9a6b-43ce7f3a8c59,Entrepreneur,"We are building a SaaS platform to simplify and manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for developers. Our goal is to help developers, particularly those in small startups or SMBs, quickly and securely deploy cloud resources without worrying about manual errors or complex configuration.

With our platform, you can seamlessly manage your infrastructure in a user-friendly interface or via natural language input. Here's how it works:

1. **Log in and Authorization**:First, you log into our platform and configure your cloud provider credentials (e.g., GCP service account using a private key or OAuth 2.0 authorization). You then enter your project ID.
2. **Resource Creation**:After authentication, you can easily select a template for the resource you want to create, such as a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The platform will walk you through the process of entering configurable parameters like bucket name, region, and access controls.
3. **Automated Deployment**:Once you've entered the necessary values, our platform will automatically deploy the resource to your cloud project, ensuring that all configurations are correct and free of errors.
4. **Auditability & Access Control**:Every resource deployment is fully auditable, giving you full visibility into your infrastructure. You can also set project policies to control access levels— for example, only super admins may delete resources or make critical changes.
5. **Template Management & Resource View**:Our platform allows you to view all resources created under a specific project, organized by template. You can manage, update, and track your infrastructure in a streamlined and intuitive interface.

In essence, we take care of the heavy lifting of IaC management, allowing developers to focus on building their applications while ensuring they have control, security, and proper governance over their cloud resources.

060995f8-c63b-4f78-9153-ffdc8df05fa8,Entrepreneur,"In 2015, my father and I started a side hustle inspired by our personal story—helping families impacted by incarceration reconnect, heal, and thrive. For seven years, I worked my full-time job while managing this business at night and on weekends. It wasn’t easy, but I wasn’t ready to make the leap.

Then everything changed in 2020. My grandmother’s passing and turning 30 forced me to reevaluate what I wanted in life. I realized there’s never a perfect time to take the leap—so I created one. In February 2022, I quit my job to run my business full-time. Today marks three years since that decision.

Here are some reflections:

**TL;DR:** Business is TOUGH. Imposter syndrome is real, failure is scary, but discipline and adaptability can get you through. Totally worth it.

**The Fear and Reality**

My biggest fear before making the leap was that I’d fail miserably, go broke, embarrass myself in front of everyone, and not be able to feed my family. In my head, it felt like the worst-case scenario was inevitable.

In reality? None of that happened. I prepared by saving up enough to build a safety cushion and then focused on refining our business strategy. Once I had a clear path to sustainability, things got much easier. Not easy—but manageable.

**Imposter Syndrome & Rough Patches**

Imposter syndrome never really goes away. Even after three years, I sometimes wonder if I’m doing a good job. But then I remind myself: *It takes some skill to last three years in business.* That thought keeps me going.

Rough patches? There have been plenty. A few highlights:

* Every year, our free summer camp that we offer has had to move locations mid-program due to landlord issues. It's a logistical nightmare and really impacts the quality of the program.
* Last summer, a delayed payment from a partner almost meant we couldn’t make payroll. Watching that unfold felt like seeing a train coming and being powerless to stop it.
* In late 2023, we lost a long-term partner, which was a big blow.
* List goes on...

But with each challenge, we adjusted, adapted, and kept moving forward.

(Shameless plug: If you know any companies that might be interested in helping to sponsor our 2025 summer camp, PLEASE message me. It's an 8 week camp for 30-60 children. We provide employment to high school students to help run it. It's a great experience all around. Funding is looking shaky for 2025 but these kids need it. PM me and I can provide more details.)

**Pivoting & Growth**

In 2024, we expanded into addressing opioid use disorder (OUD) in our community. It created a new revenue stream while allowing us to better serve the families we were already working with. That pivot helped us expand.

**Discipline & Balance**

Discipline is everything. After going full-time, I started working out consistently. Fitness became my outlet for managing stress. Showing up and putting in my reps—both in the gym and in business—has been my survival strategy.

**Hard Truths**

Here’s what no one tells you: *Money doesn’t fix everything.* I’m far from rich, but I am able to sustain without going to a traditional 9-5. I thought leaving my job would solve all my problems. It didn’t. I just traded one set of challenges for another—though I’ll admit I prefer these.

**Mentors & Resources That Got Me Through**

I didn’t get here alone. I leaned on advice from people I admired:

* **Omari Harebin**, author of *The Corporate Dropout*, served as a mentor and a friend.
* **Rohan Gilkes**—His reddit posts opened my eyes to what was possible as an entrepreneur.
* **Noah Kagan**—I watched his older youtube videos for years while hiding in the office.
* *Tim Ferriss’* *The 4-Hour Workweek* fundamentally changed how I think about business.
* Podcasts like *How I Built This*, *Side Hustle School*, and *My First Million* were constant inspiration.

**Advice for Anyone Considering the Leap**

If you’re sitting in a cubicle or on your couch wondering if you should take the leap, here’s my advice: Make a plan and go for it. There will never be a ""perfect"" time.

If you love your job, don’t quit. Find a way to make it work.

There have been moments I considered going back to corporate life. Running a business is TOUGH. I end up in what I call ""administrative purgatory"" at least once a month. 

But something in me keeps pushing forward, curious to see how far I can go."

b4cb006b-08e2-4ef1-a849-00556a59e151,Entrepreneur,"Tl,DR at the bottom. So I have a client I built a website for back in 2021. It was a podcast website for a local destination business. For privacy, I'll call it ""Pickle Bay Podcast""

Alice and Betty (fake names for privacy) are both equal 50% owners in the business. Betty paid me with her money to make the website. A few months ago, Betty asked that I take the website down, as her and her retiring husband are going to refresh it later. Recently, Alice called and asked why the website was down. I said it was down because Betty asked me to take it down. Betty is avoiding Alice, as Alice wants to talk about using the Pickle Bay Podcast name if Betty won't use it. 

Alice asked me to put the site back up today because she has business plans for it this month. I said I'm happy to do it *if* we temporarily use a different domain like ""PickleBayNews\[.\]com"" while she and Betty sort out whatever issue they have. I accepted payment to put the site back up, with the expectation that we were going to use the PickleBayNews\[.\]com domain. Today, Alice says no let's use PickleBayPodcast\[.\]com. The problem is, I am concerned about Alice and Betty asking for conflicting things. Alice wants the site up now, while Betty wants the site down. Betty is not talking to Alice right now. Alice says Betty is avoiding her. Alice is also saying I ""don't need"" to talk to Betty to see what she thinks about this.

And through all of this, I also need (well, would really *like*) to get paid because my expenses are higher than usual this month. What I'm thinking about doing is just putting the site back up and then emailing Betty to let her know that Alice paid for it, and that I hope that the two of them can sort something out. I don't want Betty to feel like I'm going behind her back (I don't need that kind of reputation), which is why I intend to just let her know. What do you think I should do in this situation?

**TL,DR:**

* Breakdown in communication between two equal owners of my client's business leads  to conflicting website requests: one wants the site down, other wants the site up
* Original paying client (Betty) requested takedown, but equal partner (Alice) sent payment to restore the site. Alice is ignoring developer (OP) recommendation to temporarily use different web domain while Alice sorts out the conflict with Betty.
* Developer (OP) seeks balance between maintaining professional reputation and managing financial needs, while navigating co-owners' dispute. What do you think OP should do?"
28ea25dc-6389-4e36-be4d-9ebf5d921cbe,Entrepreneur,"Disclaimer: My friend gave me consent to post this as his account is too new to post this on Reddit

I (23M) attended an elite private high school and later MIT between 2018-22, but one of my best friends (25M) who is delegated as CTO for my next tech startup and is equally as intelligent as me attended UMass Boston between January 2018 and December 2021. He was also diagnosed with autism in 2004 at age 4, and with both of his parents and family members being ableist, his education was stunted and he never reached his full potential.

Fun fact, during his teenage years, his parents nearly forced him to unfriend me (if I wasn’t friends with him, his network would be pathetic as few of his classmates/friends attend T20 universities and many attend regular universities; also he was ostracised due to being in a special ed homeroom during middle school), but due to him going NC with his parents in 2017 (age 17) and moving out on his own and later using student loans to rent a $900/month studio in 2018 and investing, he was able to maintain a friendship with me that he has held since 2001.

Similar to me, he has been obsessed with success and the Ivy League from a young age (before 10 years old). During elementary school, he has been self teaching math, science, history, geography, economics, computers, computer science, and IT at 3 grades above his grade level (he was held back during Preschool, so 2 grades above his age level). He received decent grades (mostly A’s with some B’s in English language arts) throughout his K-12 run, and won some awards, notably winning his elementary school’s math competition in 4th grade, winning his elementary school’s science fair in 5th grade, and scored #2 (6th grade), #2 (7th grade), and #1 (8th grade) out of 1000 at his middle school’s Geography Bee.

He was placed on an IEP in 2005, was in a self contained special ed class between 2005 and 2007 (first grade), exited special ed but remained on an IEP (until the end of 8th grade), and his behaviour (conduct/effort), autism symptoms, and grades vastly improved due to this. He moved to another school district between 5th and 6th grade due to his parents buying a McMansion in another town, was sent to special ed again (until the 8th grade), and his education was stunted ever since. He was placed in a 4th grade math class during 3rd grade, and later 5th (during 4th) and 6th grade math (during 5th), but in 6th grade, even though he thrived during 5th grade/6th grade math, when he moved to a new school district, he was relegated to a 6th grade special ed math class instead of a 7th grade math class despite receiving an A the previous year.

At high school (September 2015), he was sent to a private Catholic high school where 15% of students came from his old middle school and despite being placed in all honors, he was expelled due to being bullied with the bullies going unpunished. Afterwards, he attended an online school, where he finished 10th, 11th, and 12th grade in just 12 months with a 3.75 unweighted GPA taking a few college-level courses at his online high school's university extension catalog as they didn't approve any AP courses taken outside nor did they offer AP courses. He took US History, Algebra based Physics, and Differential/Integral Calculus and even AP Biology, but just for fun. 

He received an 800 on the Math SAT and a 480 on the English SAT during 11th grade in December 2016.

After graduating from high school in May 2017, he moved to Boston, and started majoring in Computer Science at UMB in January 2018. Due to PTSD/anxiety/depression, he flunked during the first two years. His cousin (who studied at BU at the time) also threatened him with false SA allegations despite the fact he had zero contact with her, which caused several sleepless nights and caused his grades to falter. He also had to work at McDonalds and then Doordash since March 2020 as he was fired from McDonalds to keep afloat, so despite having learned Python/Java/JS up to the intermediate level at 10 years old, he never formally took any CS courses nor did he learn about algorithms, so he received mostly B/B- in CS courses. His GPA during the first two years was estimated to be a 3.1.

Due to the fact his cousin graduated and moved to another state in 2020 to pursue medical school, his anxiety decreased, and he was able to focus more on studying.

Things got under control as he switched to IT and afterwards, he received a 3.9 GPA for the last 2 years, ending his college life with a 3.5 GPA, barely meeting cum laude.

He applied to more than 300 internships between Summer 2019 and Summer 2021 only for them to ghost his resume despite having fixed it numerous times. He also couldn't even start an IT club despite two straight years of attempts as his college is a commuter college and the vast majority of IT students are non-traditional and some never even show up for class. 

After graduation, he mostly relied on his investment portfolio he bought all the way in 2018/9 to keep afloat and even though he sold some of his stocks in late 2021, he bought more in early 2023, due to the AI boom. He held two internships so far (an IT one at a local restaurant in Summer 22 and a webdev one at a small local bank in Summer 23) and during his pastime, I watch numerous MOOCs and OCW courses and hold a research fellowship with his university professor, first at UMass Boston, and later at BU the following semester.

He received his first full time job as a remote web development independent contractor (not W2) in fall 2023 where he makes 80k (as of 2025, his wages increased to 90k) and is currently working on his GRE and applying to OMSCS.

Luckily, he met Paul English (co-founder and former CTO of Kayak and UMass Boston alum). Biz Stone was an alumni at his university, and Jan Koum attended SJSU. Also, his high school classmate and valedictorian attended Harvard and later got into YCombinator. 

TL;DR: Given the fact 2025 further entrenched the social class system in the US and the fact colleges become more and more competitive, I am curious if going to UMass Boston and lower end podunk universities make it impossible to get investors, find a quality network, and spearhead a successful tech startup. I know the chances are low even for HYPSM and FAANG, but would it be impossible for a UMass Boston/second tier state school/community college alumni? Unfortunately, even though my friend networked with at least 100 students at UMass Boston, none are particularly ambitious and many are stuck in entry level SWE/IT jobs at less prestigious companies/maybe even small businesses. Does UMass Boston and a pathetic post-middle school resume make it impossible to network with Harvard/MIT students and alumni, even if my friend were to move into Cambridge? He does have a sizeable Linkedin and Discord, but would HYPSM students simply ignore UMass Boston students?

I am a m27 and finish university this year. I have ADHD and I am not lazy, but at every internship I underperformed after the first weeks because I cannot motivate myself longer when I don’t see a valuable outcome for me. Simple tasks I don’t understand because I invest zero, but complex tasks which demand intense problem solving skills it motivates me and I come up with an Idea. That means, it’s either fun to do or I can actually learn something, otherwise I cannot hold up a consistent level. 

I soon have to decide if I join a PhD program or if I go into consultancy to stay in a more dynamic atmosphere which hopefully gives me more expertise for building up something by my own. My whole life it has been my dream to start something by my own. Unfortunately, I have nobody in my environment who made this step and something holds me back. I am a risk seeking person, that is not the problem, but my family is very conservative and I already pushed it to the edges. 

So I want to know from you, what was that last step which made you starting your own thing? Or did you start it by side, until you felt it started working out? I can imagine, I build a wall in my head and it’s not such a big step, you just have to do it."

I think the most challenging part is ensuring the high quality and consistency of my work. In fact, content distribution, editing, and uploading are all low-skill but time-consuming repetitive tasks. Especially when it comes to communicating with clients, that’s the most time-consuming part. As you know, clients always try to use their charm to get your product for the lowest price possible… So, don’t waste time on that. It’s also important to find your niche market, but the key is still producing high-quality work. At least make sure your work is just a bit better than others’.

On the contrary, there are many ways to drive traffic, and I’ve chosen video platforms instead of social media. It still offers valuable insights, and I welcome anyone with similar experiences to connect with me.

————————————————————————

Since last July, I’ve been following the development of AI Influencers, Deepfake, and FaceSwap technologies on YouTube. With a powerful enough PC, I decided to experiment with these tools and eventually sought ways to monetize them.

  
**LAUNCHING**

I started by uploading videos to MrDeepFakes to gain exposure while directing potential buyers to my Telegram channel for full-length content. To maximize reach, I operated multiple accounts, distributing different videos to maintain high rankings. This strategy worked well in driving traffic, but it also flooded my inbox with messages from users who had no intention of paying.

  
**SELLING THE FULL VIDS**

Custom orders became both an opportunity and a challenge. While high-quality, personalized videos brought in more revenue, managing client requests and training models to meet expectations required extensive time and effort. The biggest issue was that many users just kept asking questions without actually purchasing anything.

Payments were another hurdle. Some users preferred PayPal, others cryptocurrency, and some asked for Wise transactions. Managing multiple accounts not only complicated the process but also introduced risks of exposing my identity. 

I initially explored subscription-based platforms like OnlyFans, but they immediately banned my account. Fanvue seemed like an alternative, but they ended up freezing my entire balance. In contrast, DFans provided a more stable and creator-friendly environment for this type of content, making it my primary platform for monetization.

  
**A ROUGH PATCH**

By November, competition intensified, and my visibility dropped sharply. More creators with similar content flooded MrDeepFakes, forcing me to shift focus toward enhancing video quality. At this point, relying solely on SEO was no longer enough—differentiation, secure monetization channels, and efficient user management became the keys to staying ahead.

The market will continue evolving, but adapting with the right tools and platforms remains the most crucial factor for long-term success.

1fa7bacb-5518-42bb-85f1-02e45dedb470,Entrepreneur,"I (25f) started a business as a newborn care specialist about a year ago. If you don’t know what that is, I take care of newborns in the home and guide parents on development, feeding, sleep etc and allow the parents to rest. I have 5 prior years of childcare experience, and work with 5 newborn clients since i started the business. I’ve done several certification classes in the field, and recently started a blog. 

Some days I feel so excited about having a business that i love. Others I feel overwhelmed as I have to be the content creator, website editor, blog writer, finance manager, and go to work every night. I spend more time at the computer than I do doing activities I enjoy, and then when I am not working on business I feel guilty. When the posts I make get no reach I feel like I wasted so much time. 

Sometimes i feel like the work I am doing is not important, or that there’s so many others in the field with way more experience so why am I even doing this. Imposter syndrome i guess. 

Does this feeling ever go away? Is there a level of “success” you reach where you start to feel like a put together professional? "

When a creator uploads a new video, the automation instantly generates optimized social media posts, newsletters, blogs, and even faceless YouTube videos with custom visuals and narration if desired.

So far, I’ve onboarded four clients who collectively have over 81.5 million views and 800,000+ subscribers, and they’ve all had great results with the automation.

ede092b6-956c-40e0-ac9c-89dd9406f315,Entrepreneur,"I’ve been running a small online store focused on two products, selling through both our website and various marketplaces. We get a few conversions daily from Google Ads and organic marketplace traffic, so sales do happen.

However, for over six months, we’ve been trying to break through on social media. My friend took charge of our accounts and did a decent job—he grew our audience to over 5K followers. The problem? It hasn’t led to a single sale. Not one. It’s as if those followers don’t exist.

His main strategy was leveraging social proof—posting podcast clips and inviting people to sign up for our newsletter with a relevant lead magnet. This approach brought in around 300 email subscribers, and we’ve been sending valuable, non-salesy content… yet still, zero conversions from email.

Meanwhile, the only people buying from us are those who see our ads or find us on marketplaces. The fact that random ad viewers convert while our engaged audience doesn’t is honestly baffling and frustrating. Shouldn’t the people getting value from us be more likely to buy?

What are we doing wrong? Have any of you experienced something similar?

Edit 1. Someone on different subreddit made me realaze It might be relevant to mention this

When we introduced new product, we have ran two remarketing campaigns on our social media (one for our current product and one for new one).

These campaigns went bad. Like soo bad I probably wanted to forget them lol

We reached most of our follower base on Instagram, and made completly no sales. Meanwhile Google ads to random people were making steady conversions."

When I look at this sub, I see a lot of people lacking basic marketing skills, and they seem genuinely surprised when no one buys their product. So, I’d like to share a few ideas on how to fix that.



Today’s tip: Curate content.



If you want to build trust with potential clients and boost your authority, start by curating valuable materials. That’s right — you don’t need to create all the content yourself. Sometimes, sharing work from others is just as effective



Subscribe to industry leaders, follow news websites, and keep an eye out for interesting cases or updates that your audience will find helpful. Then, share those insights!



You can add your own thoughts or include links to related products or services you offer. This helps your audience connect the dots between the shared information and your work.



The benefits are clear. You’ll post consistently, establish yourself as an expert by filtering out the noise and highlighting useful content, and build relationships with others in your field by sharing their work — opening the door to potential collaborations



Start curating content and make the most of it!"

ee2e04bd-9c36-4cd0-b9a1-0f399d23a2f1,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in the process of launching an online store, and I’m debating whether I should focus on my local market (Slovenia), expand to Europe, or go fully global (English-speaking markets like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia).

For context, Slovenia is a small country with only 2.1 million people, so the potential customer base is obviously limited. However, since it’s a smaller market, competition is also lower, and I could potentially dominate my niche more easily. On the other hand, targeting Europe or global markets offers a much larger audience but also comes with higher competition.

# My Plan for Fulfillment & Scaling:

I plan to start with dropshipping to minimize upfront costs and validate the market. Once I reach a certain revenue milestone, I’d transition to bulk buying inventory and either ship it myself or set up a storage/fulfillment center in the US or another key market to improve shipping times and customer experience.

# The Three Approaches I’m Considering:

1️. Start locally (Slovenia), build a strong brand presence, and then expand once I gain traction.  
2️. Target the European market first (mainly EU countries with strong e-commerce demand).  
3️. Go fully global from the start (English-speaking markets like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia).

For those of you who have launched online businesses, what has been your experience with different market sizes? Would you start small and expand, or go global right away?"

3 years of being unable to work, I've lost a lot but losing my identity and passion that was my business hits the hardest. My business truly was my main purpose aside from being a single Mum and my fitness goals and I had dreamt as a child of the life I created for myself, only to have it stolen through no fault of my own.

d9f4b923-473b-4b30-80c7-fa8d7d37fa1e,Entrepreneur,"I've built custom software to manage physical labour jobs (think plumbers, handyman, etc. type jobs). It was similar to platforms like Jobber. Work order management, scheduling, estimating, the usual stuff.

I've also built custom financial management software (I have a background in accounting). It has a very robust, full double-entry accounting back-end (debits and credits) that can produce proper financial reports like balance sheet, P&L, aged AR, aged AP, bank reconciliations, payments, invoicing, etc. Its similar to what platforms like Quickbooks or Xero can do.

But - and here's my idea - I've never seen a platform that does *both*.

I'm considering building a platform that does both really well, *and*, it would be exceedingly simple for anyone to use - even to do the bookkeeping stuff.

For example, it would be able to:

* Create estimates that can be turned into a customer & work order or project
* Generate work orders for crews
* Allow crews to complete work orders from their devices on site (smartphone/tablet)
* Generate invoices from work orders
* Track sales and outstanding receivables and payables
* Complete all bookkeeping tasks, like bank reconciliations, etc.
* Generate proper financial reports (balance sheet, P&L, etc)
* Do budgeting and forecasting
* Inventory management

I've seen a lot of platforms that can do work order management and platforms that do bookkeeping, but I've not come across a platform that does both - and does both *well* and *easily*. Usually platforms require you to ""connect"" to the bookkeeping platform like Quickbooks. But, that means have two locations for your data, and you have to learn two systems. That's inefficient!

So - my idea: build a platform that can do proper job/work order management AND full bookkeeping in a simple way so that anyone can use it (even those not normally doing bookkeeping). One platform, one source of truth for your business data.

Would anyone be interested in that kind of a platform? Or is that a terrible idea? Thoughts? "

1. **Breaking Products on Purpose**
   * *Example:* A company made a ring that breaks easily so people would buy more.
   * *Why it works:* When a mistake is planned, people think it's special and don't get upset.
2. **Turning Unusual Spaces into Ads**
   * *Example:* A person used their Twitter name to advertise their business.
   * *Why it works:* Using places no one thinks of for ads gets more attention.
3. **Naming a Business After Popular Search Words**
   * *Example:* A business named itself after common search words to appear more in search results.
   * *Why it works:* By choosing popular names, they show up more when people search online.
4. **Getting Competitors to Advertise for You**
   * *Example:* Burger King asked McDonald's to make a combined burger, knowing they'd say no. The refusal got people talking.
   * *Why it works:* Creating situations where any response benefits you is smart.
5. **Partnering with Unlikely Brands**
   * *Example:* KFC and Crocs made shoes that look and smell like fried chicken.
   * *Why it works:* Unexpected partnerships surprise people and go viral.
6. **Telling People Not to Buy Something**
   * *Example:* Patagonia told people to buy less to help the environment, which made more people buy their jackets.
   * *Why it works:* When told not to do something, people often want to do it more.
7. **Using Job Posts as Fun Ads**
   * *Example:* A company posted a job for a ""Remote Office Manager,"" which is funny because office managers usually work in offices.
   * *Why it works:* Funny job posts get shared and noticed.
8. **Playing with Celebrity Names**
   * *Example:* A cereal brand said they were loved by ""Michael Jordan,"" but it was someone with the same name, not the famous basketball player.
   * *Why it works:* Clever tricks get attention and laughs.
9. **Advertising in Unexpected Places**

It posts automated job posts for various social media all at once.

The workflow is like this.

We have a separate programm to scrap job posts from various websites.

Then, we use AI tool to turn this job post as a video and post it to YouTube to have a video link so we can include it in a message to send to social media platforms.

Then, there are another program that posts the job post every 4 hour to them.

Reddit
WhatsApp
Instagram
Twitter
Telegram
LinkedIn
TikTok
Bluesky
Emails to the users of our platform

We can also automate others if you want to like Viemos, Pinterest or more.

Would you be interested in these kind of tools?

Instead of posting a job, we can make a custom UI so you can send a text all at once to many platforms easily for example.

After making this work, we were forgetting about it but like to know if someone can be interested.

We might consider having a SaaS.

6a8ddab9-4fb0-4f79-85f8-a51a70f63b0e,Entrepreneur,"This story is more of a fun one, I was like most people starting out their first business, knew nothing, had no money, but willing to learn & understand entrepreneurship better & stay consistent.

I started out with reselling items, with a lot of costs and was net negative my first year by $4k, I did organic marketing as I didn't have any money to use for ads, I had no job & was in school. Even though there were no sales for the first 6 months of my business, I still liked running the site and improving my knowledge in business.

After 6 months, I figured out a way to gain my first solid foundation of MRR. It was a sales channel that required no capital investment. Months go by, I still only get $300-400 MRR, and I was wondering, what is my next step?

The next step was to actually find a job, so I got a minimum wage job at a call center, paying a whole $1.2k/mo. The pay for the work sucked but I didn't mind since it allowed me to grow my business. I could now spend $500 on ads a month, which turned out to be a good investment long term but short term sucked, but that is besides the point.

a little over a year I was now at $1000 revenue a month or so, my customer acquisition costs were very high, only sustainable by my 9-5 job.

But lucky for me was that a big business had seen my ad, and was interested in a partnership due to the niche I was in was fitting for them, only that it had landed in my spam mail. I took no time to even look up the business beforehand because I thought it would be some joke.

Around 24 hrs later I finished work and was walking home, thats when we had a meeting. I was under a bridge at a metro station and the guy i had a meeting with really complimented my site & the products I had, I was thankful but also thinking ""what is this crap"". I was hesitant to download all the software required for the integration with them but I thought, what the hell, it seemed legit enough & I have nothing to lose.

About 3-4 days go by and I get notifications on my phone, it was 3 sales in a day. Which had never happend before. and it happend the same the day after, and the day after the day, and never stopped, only got gradually more frequent.

6 months later I quit my job, and to now 6 months later I have a few more sales channels, many recurring customers. 

The moral of the story is to at least look at your spam post, if you see something OOTD that isn't SEO services from Prajeet or Sara Smith, maybe it might be worth something?"

122f074b-0ff7-4bdc-af7f-7110877a4950,Entrepreneur,"Hello all, this question comes from Unicorn\_9944.  I'll do my best to answer it, but before I do there is recent other Q&A post might be helpful asking about the ""first 5 moves that make the biggest impact"".

Onto my answer.  There are two key points that have to be determined to cold outreach successfully:

1. The best channel of communication to reach your target.

2. The optimal value proposition that solves the prospects' problem. 

As stated in my other post, the best channel of communication will likely hinge on who your target market is, specifically your ICP.  If you are targeting the owner of small businesses (SB) that are ""micro"" level size, say 2 to 5 employees, then contacting them via phone would likely be best.  Why?  Because they will be very easy to reach.  If the small business has maybe 50+ employees, then wrapping in email and LinkedIn may help. 

Next, the value proposition has to be spot on.  As stated in the other post, this is all about solving problems.  If I had to guess, a SB owner will be most intrigued if you can save them money.  But if that's not possible, other values can be related to time savings or growth.  As Unicorn\_9944 stated in their question to me, it stated the SB owner can get paid faster. Well, if that's true, I would make the specific calculation and impact figures for the average customer the product has made.  In turn, include those figures in your value proposition when you call, email or network.  And, again, the key is that a value prop statement must solve a problem - so simply stating figures that are intriguing is typically not enough to keep the interest high. 

Hope this helps

We’ve already got a solid portfolio and can handle pretty much anything WordPress-related. Not just the basics either. We do custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work too, so we’re comfortable with advanced customizations, integrations, and more complex builds.

The technical side is solid. What I’m focused on now is getting clients consistently. I’ve seen all the usual advice like cold outreach, referrals, and niching down, but I’d rather hear from people who have actually been through it.

If you’ve built an agency from scratch, what actually worked when you were starting out? Any specific strategies that helped land those first few clients? Also, for business owners, what makes you trust a new agency enough to work with them?

Would appreciate any insights from people who’ve been through this."
58fc3eb0-7ac0-4cee-875b-9b50f448cb91,Entrepreneur,"I am a full stack developer who has a lot of experience with accounting and finance, as well as a finance degree from a good school. I started programming years ago as a hobby while being an accountant and eventually made an organic shift to programming for my company. I thought of and created software for years now, and my best product (a budget software) saved the company explicitly millions per year on bank interest, and an even larger incalculable amount from just finally being able to budget for the first time ever. 

Accounting, financial and programming knowledge seems to be pretty niche, and usually developers don’t don’t have business knowledge, and vice versa. And even if someone has some crossover experience, they are usually heavily weighted in one side over the other. 

I know other companies would have value in this, and even in industries like construction, there is a lot of opportunities and space. 

But I have NO IDEA where to start. First I’ll get an LLC I know, but then what, cold call? My fear is I’m “just a guy” and a young one at that. I don’t have any connections, and my portfolio of apps is (in its current state) only usable for my company on their network. 

Where can I even begin? If cold calling is effective to get the first, and it’s just a numbers game, I’m willing to do that. But I want to make sure I’m not missing anything"

Sam Altman and Elon Musk.

But how is Elon Musk a founder and now wants to buy it?
At the time of OpenAI's founding, Elon Musk was on the board of directors.
In 2019, OpenAI transitioned into a for-profit organization, and at that point, Elon Musk left the board.

Once OpenAI started gaining traction and becoming widely recognized,
Elon Musk publicly criticized the company, claiming that artificial intelligence would destroy humanity, and even filed lawsuits against OpenAI.

Later, Elon Musk launched Grok, an AI model available through the Twitter (now X) app.
This was an attempt to divert attention from OpenAI.

However, there's a saying:
""The early bird catches the worm,""
which essentially means that the one who takes the initiative first gets the credit.

Despite all the AI models emerging, OpenAI remains the main reference for anything related to artificial intelligence.

So, why is Elon Musk trying to buy OpenAI now?
After all the hype and the emergence of China’s AI giants, OpenAI now faces serious competition from these rising powerhouses. This is why Elon Musk is now looking to acquire OpenAI.

The big question is:
Should OpenAI seize the opportunity and sell the company for $100 billion?
Or should they reject Elon Musk’s offer—just like Yahoo once rejected the chance to buy Google for only $5 billion?

What do you think? If you were the CEO of OpenAI, in the midst of this AI competition, would you sell or not?

3758804e-16b4-487b-b960-4f56566ab1c5,Entrepreneur,"Uzair Javaid, a Ph.D. with a passion for data privacy, co-founded Betterdata to tackle one of AI's most pressing challenges: protecting privacy while enabling innovation. Recently, Betterdata secured a lucrative contract with the US Department of Homeland Security, 1 of only 4 companies worldwide to do so and the only one in Asia.

Here's how he did it:

**The Story**

>*So what's your story?*

I grew up in Peshawar, Pakistan, excelling in coding despite studying electrical engineering. Inspired by my professors, I set my sights on studying abroad and eventually earned a Ph.D. scholarship at NUS Singapore, specializing in data security and privacy. During my research, I ethically hacked Ethereum and published 15 papers—three times the requirement. While wrapping up my Ph.D., I explored startup ideas and joined Entrepreneur First, where I met Kevin Yee. With his expertise in generative models and mine in privacy, we founded Betterdata. Now, nearly three years in, we’ve secured a major contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—one of only four companies globally and the only one from Asia.

**The Startup**

>*In a nutshell, what does your startup do?*

Betterdata is a startup that uses AI and synthetic data generation to address two major challenges: data privacy and the scarcity of high-quality data for training AI models. By leveraging generative models and privacy-enhancing technologies, Betterdata enables businesses, such as banks, to use customer data without breaching privacy regulations. The platform trains AI on real data, learns its patterns, and generates synthetic data that mimics the real thing without containing any personal or sensitive information. This allows companies to innovate and develop AI solutions safely and ethically, all while tackling the growing need for diverse, high-quality data in AI development.

>*How did you conduct ideation and validation for your startup?*

The initial idea for Betterdata came from **personal experience.** During my Ph.D., I ethically hacked Ethereum’s blockchain, exposing flaws in encryption-based data sharing. This led me to explore AI-driven deep synthesis technology—similar to deepfakes but for structured data privacy. With GDPR impacting 28M+ businesses, I saw a massive opportunity to help enterprises securely share data while staying compliant.

To validate the idea, I spoke to **50 potential customers**—a number that strikes the right balance. Some say 100, but that’s impractical for early-stage founders. At 50, patterns emerge: if 3 out of 10 mention the same problem, and this repeats across 50, you have 10–15 strong signals, making it a solid foundation for an MVP.

Instead of outbound sales, which I dislike, we used **three key methods**:

1. **Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**—targeting technically savvy users with solutions for niche problems, like scaling synthetic data for banks.
2. **Targeted Content Marketing**—regular customer conversations shaped our thought leadership and outreach.
3. **Raising Awareness Through Partnerships**—collaborating with NUS, Singapore’s PDPC, and Plug and Play to build credibility and educate the market. These strategies attracted serious customers willing to pay, guiding Betterdata’s product development and market fit.

>*How did you approach the initial building and ongoing product development?*

In the early stages, we built synthetic data generation algorithms and a basic UI for proof-of-concept, using open-source datasets to engage with banks. We quickly learned that banks wouldn't share actual customer data due to privacy concerns, so we had to conduct on-site installations and gather feedback to refine our MVP. Through **continuous consultation with customers**, we discovered real enterprise data posed challenges, such as missing values, which led us to adapt our prototype accordingly. This **iterative approach of listening to customer feedback and observing their usage** allowed us to improve our product, enhance UX, and address unmet needs while building trust and loyalty.

Working closely with our customers also gives us a **data advantage**. Our solution’s effectiveness depends on customer data, which we can't fully access, but bridging this knowledge gap gives us a competitive edge. The more customers we test on, the more our algorithms adapt to diverse use cases, making it harder for competitors to replicate our insights.

My approach to iteration is simple: **focus solely on customer feedback and ignore external noise** like trends or advice. The key question for the team is: which customer is asking for this feature or solution? As long as there's a clear answer, we move forward. External influences, such as AI hype, often bring more confusion than clarity. True long-term success comes from solving real customer problems, not chasing trends.

**Customers may not always know exactly what they want, but they understand their problems.** Our job is to identify these problems and solve them in innovative ways. While customers may suggest specific features, we stay focused on solving the core issue rather than just fulfilling their exact requests. The idea aligns with the quote often attributed to Henry Ford: ""If I asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."" The key is understanding their problems, not just taking requests at face value.

>*How do you assess product-market fit?*

To assess product-market fit, we track two key metrics:

1. **Customers' Willingness to Pay**: We measure both the quantity and quality of meetings with potential customers. A high number of meetings with key decision-makers signals genuine interest. At Betterdata, we focused on getting meetings with people in banks and large enterprises to gauge our product's resonance with the target market.
2. **How Much Customers Are Willing to Pay**: We monitor the price customers are willing to pay, especially in the early stages. For us, large enterprises, like banks, were willing to pay a premium for our synthetic data platform due to the growing need for privacy tech. This feedback guided our product refinement and scaling strategy.

By focusing on these metrics, we refined our product and positioned it for scaling.

>*What is your business model?*

We employ a structured, phase-driven approach for out business model, as a B2B startup. I initially struggled with focusing on the core value proposition in sales, often becoming overly educational. Eventually, we developed a product roadmap with models that allowed us to match customer needs to specific offerings and justify our pricing. Our pricing structure includes project-based pilots and annual contracts for successful deployments. At Betterdata, our customer engagement unfolds across three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Trial and Benchmarking** \- We start with outreach and use open-source datasets to showcase results, offering customers a trial period to evaluate the solution.
2. **Phase 2: Pilot or PoC** \- After positive trial results, we conduct a PoC or pilot using the customer’s private data, with the understanding that successful pilots lead to an annual contract.
3. **Phase 3: Multi-Year Contracts** \- Following a successful pilot, we transition to long-term commercial contracts, focusing on multi-year agreements to ensure stability and ongoing partnerships.

>*How do you do marketing for your brand*?

We take a non-conventional approach to marketing, focusing on answering one key question: Which customers are willing to pay, and how much? This drives our messaging to show how our solution meets their needs. Our strategy centers around two main components:

1. **Building a network of lead magnets** \- These are influential figures like senior advisors, thought leaders, and strategic partners. Engaging with institutions like IMDA, SUTD, and investors like Plug and Play helps us gain access to the right people and foster warm introductions, which shorten our sales cycle and ensure we’re reaching the right audience.
2. **Thought leadership** \- We build our brand through customer traction, technology evidence, and regulatory guidelines. This helps us establish credibility in the market and position ourselves as trusted leaders in our field.

This holistic approach has enabled us to navigate diverse market conditions in Asia and grow our B2B relationships. By focusing on these areas, we drive business growth and establish strong trust with stakeholders.

>*What's your advice for fundraising?*

Here are my key takeaways for other founders when it comes to fundraising:

1. **Fundraise When You Don’t Need To** We closed our seed round in April 2023, a time when we weren't actively raising. Founders should always be in fundraising mode, even when they're not immediately in need of capital. Don’t wait until you have only a few months of runway left. Keep the pipeline open and build relationships. When the timing is right, execution becomes much easier. For us, our investment came through a combination of referrals and inbound interest. Even our lead investor initially rejected us, but after re-engaging, things eventually fell into place. It’s crucial to stay humble, treat everyone with respect, and maintain those relationships for when the time is right.
2. **Be Mindful of How You Present Information** When fundraising, how you present information matters a lot. We created a comprehensive, easily digestible investment memo, hosted on Notion, which included everything an investor might need—problem, solution, market, team, risks, opportunities, and data. The goal was for investors to be able to get the full picture within 30 minutes without chasing down extra details. We also focused on making our financial model clear and meaningful, even though a 5-year forecast might be overkill at the seed stage. The key was clarity and conciseness, and making it as easy as possible for investors to understand the opportunity. I learned that brevity and simplicity are often the best ways to make a memorable impact.
3. For the **pitch** itself, keep it simple and **focus on 4 things: problem, solution, team, and market**. If you can summarize each of these clearly and concisely, you’ll have a compelling pitch. Later on, you can expand into market segments, traction, and other metrics, but for seed-stage, focus on those four areas, and make sure you’re strong in at least three of them. If you do, you'll have a compelling case.

>*How do you run things day-to-day? i.e what's your operational workflow and team structure?*

Here's an overview of our team structure and process:

**Internally:** Our team is divided into two main areas: **backend** (internal team) and **frontend** (market-facing team). There's no formal hierarchy within the backend team. We all operate as equals, defining our goals based on what needs to be developed, assigning tasks, and meeting weekly to share updates and review progress. The focus is on **full ownership** of tasks and accountability for getting things done. I also contribute to product development, identifying challenges and clearing obstacles to help the team move forward.

* **Backend Team:** We approach tasks based on the scope defined by customers, with no blame or hierarchy. It's like a sports team—sometimes someone excels, and other times they struggle, but we support each other and move forward together. Everyone has the creative freedom to work in the way that suits them best, but we establish regular meetings and check-ins to ensure alignment and progress.

**Frontend Team:** For the **market-facing side**, we implement a hierarchy because the market expects this structure. If I present myself as ""CEO,"" it signals authority and credibility. This distinction affects how we communicate with the market and how we build our brand. The frontend team is split into four main areas:

1. **Business**
2. **Product (Software Engineering)**
3. **Machine Learning Engineering**
4. **R&D**

The **C-suite** sits at the top, followed by **team leads**, and then the **executors**. We distill market expectations into actionable tasks, ensuring that everyone is clear on their role and responsibilities.

**Process:**

* We start by receiving **market expectations** and defining tasks based on them.
* Tasks are assigned to relevant teams, and execution happens with **no communication barriers** between team members. This ensures seamless collaboration and focused execution.
* The main goal is always **effectiveness**—getting things done efficiently while maintaining flexibility in how individuals approach their work.

In both teams, there's an emphasis on accountability, collaboration, and clear communication, but the structure varies according to the nature of the work and external expectations."

Through my work experience, I've built good relationships with my subcontractor community. Due to the economics of our past few projects, our subcontractor pool has become increasingly less sophisticated. Lower cost subcontractors typically don't have back office staff, marketing, legal, etc.

  
After finishing a building a few months ago, I had a few homeowners ask for a recommendation for pavers and pedestals on their concrete deck. Knowing I was going to be at the building daily doing punch list and finishing units on higher floors, I decided to try something new. I offered the homeowners a chance for a low cost option - Pay me cash and I would hire a subcontractor to perform the work. I charged the homeowner $20/sqft and the sub that typically charged me $16/sqft and $14/sqft if I paid him cash. Everything went off without a hitch and I ended up doing couple thousand square feet and making a good chunk of change across the homeowners.

  
I'm wondering if anyone has any experience replicating this across multiple trades (or even with one). I have more than just this paver installer who could fit this model. I have a tile installer, countertop installer, fencing installer and landscaper who could all work in a similar fashion. This isn't just lead generation - I would be the client-facing person, money collector, etc (probably not trying to replicate the cash portion of this scheme. Should go legit). I don't necessarily want to be licensed, bonded, insured... this would have to flow up from my subs if it was needed. This way I can remain the low cost provider.

  
Opening for discussion!

Your business will also be eligible to be recommended to other users just by signing up. From here, you can upload your static ads to the Ai analyzer and it will give you actionable feedback on your ad in order to boost conversion.

I've only been able to make $1000 in the last 8 months since we launched. Mostly through podcast interviews. I'm thinking of closing down the business and would love some advice. Do you guys think I should keep going? I just don't think that people will want to do the work involved of hosting a workshop even though they can make $100K a year from it. What do you think? Need some help. 
8cd89632-2d2d-44c7-a9c4-1ddfc61995b7,Entrepreneur,"I didn’t expect to find patterns. At first, it seemed like just a mix of normal customer interactions, some were quick and transactional, others dragged on. Some customers were polite, some impatient. Some were clear about what they wanted, while others barely knew how to explain their issue.

But after listening to over 100+ business call logs from home service companies, I started noticing trends, recurring struggles that kept coming up in almost every business. And if these call logs are any indication, I’d bet a lot of home service businesses are unknowingly losing customers because of phone interactions.

**Here’s what I learned:**

**1. Most Missed Calls Were from High-Intent Customers**

When a potential customer calls a plumber, electrician, or HVAC company, they’re usually not calling to chat. They have an urgent problem. Their AC is broken. Their toilet is overflowing. They need help... Right now.

Yet, in almost every call log I analyzed, a good percentage of these calls went unanswered.

The worst part? Most customers never called back.

Data backs this up, 67% of customers won’t leave a voicemail, and 80% won’t call again. They just move on to the next business on Google.

How many of those calls were worth $500, $1,000, or more?

**2. The First 15 Seconds Can Make or Break a Sale**

Even when a call was answered, the opening seconds determined everything.

* If the greeting was rushed or unclear, customers sounded hesitant for the rest of the call.
* If the call went straight to ""Hold, please,"" the drop-off rate spiked.
* If the receptionist or call handler sounded unprepared, customers lost trust immediately.

I kept thinking... if a customer is calling to book a service, and the first thing they hear is confusion, frustration, or indifference, why wouldn’t they just call someone else?

First impressions matter, and on the phone, they happen faster than you think.

**3. Most Calls Were Wasted on Repetitive, Low-Value Questions**

You’d be surprised at how many call logs were just:

* **""Do you service my area?""**
* **""What’s your pricing?""**
* **""Can I get an appointment today?""**

Not only did these eat up time, but they also clogged up the phone lines for higher-value calls(people actually ready to book).

And yet, when these questions weren’t answered quickly and clearly, the potential customer sounded less confident about booking.

A small detail, but huge for conversion rates\*\*.\*\*

**4. Call Handling Was Often an Afterthought**

Here’s what surprised me the most:

Most home service businesses spend a ton of time on:

* **Marketing** (ads, SEO, social media)
* **Operations** (hiring, training, equipment)
* **Customer service** (in-person interactions, job quality)

But when it came to how calls were answered, how leads were handled, and how first impressions were made on the phone?

It was usually reactive, not strategic.

No scripts. No process for handling objections. No system for prioritizing high-value calls over tire-kickers.

And yet, this is the first step of the customer journey for most businesses.

It made me wonder: How many businesses are investing in lead generation, just to lose those leads over the phone?

**Final Thoughts: How Many Customers Are Slipping Through the Cracks?**

After going through 100+ call logs, one thing was clear... most home service businesses are unknowingly losing customers every single day just because of how their calls are handled.

* **Missed calls → Customers booking elsewhere**
* **Poor first impressions → Lost trust, lower conversion rates**
* **No structure → Leads slipping through the cracks**

And what’s crazy? Most of these issues are fixable.

But I’m curious, for anyone running a home service business, how do you handle calls? Have you ever tracked how many leads you might be losing just from phone interactions? Would love to hear how others are approaching this."

The first version could combine self-paced online courses with live interactive sessions, parent support, and a strong community—all built around Socratic dialogue to help kids grow their critical thinking, creativity, and entrepreneurial skills.

Platforms like Outschool, CS Primer, Maker Division, and The Futur Pro Group inspire me.

Do you know anyone who’s built something similar or has suggestions on where I could get advice?

For context, the founder of the school where I work as Chief Product Officer has been innovating in education for 35 years.

Our students have gone on to do incredible things—some thriving in traditional schools (like at Harvard), while others have built businesses and made $200,000+ by age 17. What’s even more important is that they’ve avoided the issues that many high schoolers face: 75% feeling unhappy, two-thirds disengaged, and many battling depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.

I aim to amplify what we’re already doing by offering resources, mostly free at first, and gradually introducing more ambitious products that could require funding.

Does anyone come to mind? Whether you know them or not?

Thanks so much!"

03a538da-58f5-4850-aee3-01c41d6ccbb0,Entrepreneur,"This was a great question sent in from **straus\_aus\_haus**.  

As an entrepreneur there are so many tasks and activities you can complete but prioritizing what's most impactful on the sales front is rather difficult.  The answer below is assuming there is no sales motion yet and we are starting from scratch.  

Here are my top 5 moves to make the biggest impact:

1. Research and carve out your ideal customer profile (ICP).  Your ICP is the IDEAL type of company (or contact) you want as a customer.  The more specific you are in developing the profile, the more precise you will be in developing your prospect/lead list within your target market.  Note: you can always change your ICP, but having one from the beginning sets you up to know if you're successful within your intended target market.

2. Develop a value proposition that solves problems for your ICP and brings real value.  Whatever your product or service is, the customer base will care more about their problems than your offerings' features.  Their problems are the only reason why your product or service exists - and your value proposition must state this. And the more acute the problem, the more your value proposition should drive at that point.  Note that offering real value means there is a way to measure the problem solving your product or service offers such as saving time, saving money, alleviating headaches, etc.  Strong recommendation: your pitch should be simple and memorable so you and your team can regurgitate it with ease!

3. Curate your prospect list.  Depending on what type of resourcing you have, you can develop a prospect list with ease with contact types and contact information by using database tools such as ZoomInfo, 6sense, etc.  To re-emphasize the point of having an ICP, during this particular task it becomes easier for you to source the companies and contacts you want to start your outreach with because the characteristics have already been settled. 

4. Start activating your prospecting work with a robust cadence of touches.  Did you know that the most successful prospecting sales pros will reach out to their leads and find success after their 5th or 6th attempt?  I had team members that use to build 12 to 13 touch cadences for any given prospect.  Also, they will spread out their touches across their entire arsenal of communication channels to ensure their content gets to their prospect i.e. emails, LinkedIn, phone, voicemails, etc.  

5. Book meetings and never ""pitch on the fly"".  Hypothetically, you are in a business where you are cold calling and reaching out to contacts via phone.  If you get ahold of someone, that's a great start.  But just be cautious of overselling and not taking the preferred and professional approach of scheduling a formal call or virtual meeting.  There are several reasons why this is beneficial.  The best part is it gives you time to prepare for the meeting, take control the way that you want, and present the value that you believe is best for your prospect.  

Hope this helps!"

My biggest worry is setting everything up correctly, managing it from abroad, handling bookkeeping, and finally dealing with taxes as a non-resident.

What I’ll try to achieve:

Operate all upcoming U.S. and North American businesses with the least amount of complexity.

Be able to grow and finance new entities easily.

Maintain a clear, easy-to-manage structure that I can expand.

Be open to acquiring or investing in other U.S. businesses, where the stake could eventually be under 80% ownership in the future.

Start as quickly as possible with my core offering.

Potentially open a pathway to a Business Visa, allowing me to travel and work among the U.S. companies for 4–5 months each year during the early years.

Keep administrative, regulatory, and tax management/filing costs relatively low (an extra $10,000 a year would make a difference).

Avoid needing to travel to the holding LLC’s state just to manage basic tasks like adding a shareholder or selling a subsidiary.


What I do:

Main: Online sales of my own brands

Main: Small-scale manufacturing

Upcoming: SaaS businesses

My brands and IP are currently owned by me personally

Estimated total yearly revenue of all U.S. entities would likely be under $50 million for the first few years

I anticipate around $10 million in revenue and $1 million in profits, which I’d like to reinvest into subsidiaries when needed (ideally before taxes)


Complications:

I really want to set up manufacturing and shipping in Florida, because I have direct flights there and can visit easily.

I’m an EU resident and plan to stay that way for the foreseeable future, but I’d like to be able to visit and help actively build the U.S. businesses without always working from across the pond.


What I found so far:

1. A Wyoming Holding LLC that would establish or buy and wholly own all U.S. subsidiaries. It would be taxed as a pass-through entity, meaning I, as the owner, would pay federal taxes on the Wyoming Holding LLC’s profits. Because of a tax treaty with my EU country, I could claim this in my country of residency and only pay the difference there.

I, as the beneficiary, would file a U.S. and an EU tax return each year. My understanding is that all profits from the subsidiaries would pass through to the holding, so the subsidiaries would essentially pay only state income taxes, and I, as the owner, would pay U.S. federal income taxes.



Questions:

Is my understanding of the above structure more or less correct?

How do I finance the Wyoming holding so it can set up, fund startup costs, make bigger purchases, or buy subsidiaries—and can those be claimed as expenses?

How complicated is it to gather all the necessary documents to establish a fully functioning company, including bank accounts?

Does it make sense to choose Wyoming for a subsidiary handling online sales, or does it not matter because of sales nexus and the need to register anyway?

Do I need multiple bookkeepers in different states to manage all LLCs, or can a single Florida bookkeeping company handle everything?


Part 2
I’m still unsure if a Wyoming LLC holding is better than a corporate structure (C Corp). As I understand it, a corporation would pay around 21% federal income tax, and if it distributes dividends to stakeholders, I—being an EU resident—wouldn’t need to pay taxes on capital gains in the U.S., or I’d pay at most 5% because of a tax treaty with my EU home country. I could then deduct that 5% on my EU tax return and pay any difference owed in the EU.

Two things I’m most curious about:

1. Building and accumulating capital in the U.S. holding to develop subsidiaries. If it’s a pass-through, I, as the owner, have to pay federal taxes each year, which reduces cash flow and working capital. Is personal federal income tax in a pass-through higher than corporate federal taxes?


2. Some of the companies will use IP in the form of software and brands that I’ve built over the years, and they’ll need to pay a fee or royalty in the future. I will probably also develop new IP (such as brands) in the U.S.



I know this is complex, but I hope some of you can help me structure my thoughts so I can finally decide on the next step.

Thank you for reading, and I wish a wonderful day to each and every one of you. 🍒

Imagine you’re walking through the mall, and a bakery worker hands you a **free, warm chocolate chip cookie**. You didn’t ask for it, 

And she smile and say, **“Here you go honey, try one on the house!”**  (if the worker was bold enough to say Honey)

You take a bite

it’s Soo damn delicious. 

Now, even though there was NO way you were to buy cookies today, 

But you feel a little **obligated** to return the favor. (Basically feeling like punk for not being grateful)

So, you step inside and buy a full box.  

Why?

Was it because the cashier was Soo damn hot that you wanted to talk to her? (that's one of the reasons 😅)

Or was it because the cookie was Soo damn good that you can't say no to?

It's really a combination of all, but what really stands out more is…

Because when someone gives us something **FOR FREE**, 

we naturally feel like **giving back** (we have been thought to be this way since the day we were babies licking our feet toes)

whether it’s buying something, saying yes to a request, or just feeling grateful toward that hot worker.  

So as Marketers we pretty much abuse this all the time like all time

**free samples, free guides, free trials** (that's way there's piles of free weight loss programs out there which is called a lead magnet.)

because once you get something valuable for free, 

you're much more likely to **return the favor** by….  

Well, hopefully buying.

See how that works?

And that's reciprocity on the duty.

So what do you think?

Cool right?

And trust me reciprocity isn't just about the free stuff.

Even saying kind words and complimenting others can increase reciprocity (pretty much that's why the hot worker said Honey)

And one another reason the hot worker used and pretty much the factor that made the sale…

It's…

Gonna be explained in the next post.

See you tomorrow bye bye. ✌️

98bb5ffa-7198-4806-b52a-6262f49b7aeb,Entrepreneur,"TLDR: Build the simplest idea if you’re a ""normal"" dude; if you’re in the top 0.1% of your field, you can succeed with complex tech. Otherwise, the probability of failure is too high.

I've been thinking about this for a while, especially in the context of startups. It's started with the meme of the normal distribution curve—where the ""smart"" answer lies at the extremes. For me, this logic applies to building in tech.

# Left side of the curve

You're not an expert in any field; you're not the king of bioscience, AI, or deep tech. That doesn’t mean you’re not intelligent or brilliant; rather, you’re more of a generalist. You will succeed by building simple ideas (sometime too simple and people esp. VC are not following you) that can generate tons of cash and create real projects by focusing on execution and solving real-world problems.

Examples:

* AirBnB: Too expensive to stay in a hotel.
* Uber: Taxis sucks.
* Dropbox: Difficult to manage file storage simply.

# Middle of the curve

You might be in the wrong space. Not being an expert means understanding the pain is going to take a long time, VC are not really going to follow you upfront (except if you have incredible execution) . You may be trying to address a complex issue in a market you don’t fully understand, potentially lacking experience. Sometime, you will compete with giants like Google and OpenAI may be overly challenging, since one announcement could jeopardize your project.

# Right side of the curve

You're in the top 0.1% of your field— AI, biotech, or another deeptech —you possess the credibility and network to tackle complex problems. You can attract top talent because people want to work with you. Investors are more inclined to support you due to their confidence in your ability to execute ambitious ideas.

Examples: Mistral, OpenAI, Moderna

What about super-vertical startups? Honestly, I’m not sure how to categorize them. They might fit on the left side, but I’m uncertain. I wonder if ""anyone"" can solve a very specific pain point in a niche. What happens when they attempt to scale? Sometimes, they struggle to enter new markets, while other times, they become like Figma (start with designers and end up being used by everyone).

This question was sent to me by MehtaWP\_.  Here's my answer to the question:

From a B2B perspective, I believe that cold outreach via LinkedIn is very much a toss up for success.  I would never firmly put all my eggs in the LI platform for cold outreach.  IMHO it is as good as cold email depending on how well you personalize and construct the content of your message. 

Other basic reasons I don't consider it ""best"" is that LinkedIn is not utilized by all professionals, nor are the users on the platform on a consistent basis, especially high ranking executives who would have purchasing power.   

The other major issue is cost.  LinkedIn Sales Navigator subscriptions, which allow professionals to source new ""leads"" on the platform, has a monthly/annual subscription cost along with messaging limits (50 per month).  

But let's assume for a moment you have a very large target market (TAM, SAM, and SOM), and you have the capital to pay for such tools, LinkedIn (Premium or Sales Navigator) can be one of many tools to utilize in your cold outreach.  The tech stack you create would need be tailored to you how large your market is and what type of depth of prospecting/outreach you need to accomplish, but the ROI can be impactful if done well.

As I've been spending a little bit of time perusing through this Reddit sub, and I thought I would spend some time over the next few weeks offering some free advice to you entrepreneurs.  My background is a 5x executive in early stage B2B (SaaS, tech-enabled service) companies over the last 15 years, primarily overseeing sales, account management, customer success and even some marketing/operations. 

Would it be helpful to some (or all) of you if I answered general or specific questions around B2B sales, strategy or the like?  I can get as granular as to how to cold call or as macro into hiring talent (sales reps, managers, etc) and building sales models. 

If you have specific topics or questions, please comment in the thread.  I will do my best to post those questions with my answers as new posts in the sub in the upcoming days and weeks so everyone can see them as fresh posts and engage in the new threads about those specific topics.

I had an awesome product and sold it over the last couple of years. Probably sold about 15-20k orders. Originally I was dropshipping the item, found the manufacture bought the inventory and then shipped my self. 

Entrepreneurs caught on and started to sell the same thing. People started selling my product and it just kinda faded out. I’m at the point where I have run out of product, don’t really sell it anymore. Either i shut down the business due to no sales or find something new. 

I was younger right out of college, didn’t know anything about e-commerce at the time and I didn’t have any guidance. I definitely could have made this product sell for the rest of my lifetime but just didn’t have the knowledge that I know now. For example I didn’t create my website the same thing as my product name. Someone took it and is set up for life. 

Also, I really haven’t posted any videos for the past year 

Not too sure what to do at this point. 

I feel like I need to maximize on my TikTok followers and start selling something else, just not sure what. 


Forget to mention: 

Not only did these entrepreneurs take my product, Walmart, target and a few other companies started selling it as well ughhhhhh

Anddddddd…… everyone stole my videos to create their ads and promotions "

3185cbd0-4055-424c-82ca-75a576d79ad5,Entrepreneur,"Working on my business used to be hard... but why is this?

Time-wasters like social media and video games used to be much easier for me, even though working on my company was much better for me, and i never understood why until about a year ago when i learned what i'm about to share with you.

This allowed me to WANT to work on my business, and helped me finally take off and quit my job after working for so long.

I'm going to share everything i learned of how to make your brain want to work on your company:

This is possible because of the way your brain makes decisions: Our brain centers our decision making around dopamine, this means that our brain is constantly scanning our environment for higher dopamine-inducing activities that you can do instead of what you are currently doing.

So when you are working, and you are trying to focus on something, your brain constantly scans your environment for other higher dopamine inducing activities you can do instead of work

And when your brain recognizes an activity that provides more dopamine than work, your brain wants to do that instead.

This is why your environment is so important, because the more dopamine that your environment provides, the more willpower that is necessary for you to continue working.

And when you have less dopamine inducing objects in your environment, it is easier to continue working, and the less willpower is needed.

But, you can take this to another level. The reason why your environment is so powerful, is because: if there’s nothing else that surrounds you, if there is no other activity that provides you with more dopamine than work, then your brain will gravitate towards working.

When you don’t have your phone, or any of your devices, and your environment is clear of heavy dopamine inducing objects, your brain will gravitate towards work. You don’t want any other stimulating activity to even be an option.

Essentially, you want to make working the most dopamine inducing activity available in your environment. In this scenario, you’re not constantly using your willpower to avoid another activity, because work becomes the activity that provides the most dopamine, so instead of constantly resisting something else, your brain will gravitate towards work.

And I can’t tell you enough about how powerful and life changing that utilizing this can be, this can really make work easy.

So while we can use our willpower to resist higher dopamine inducing things, we can also structure our environment, so that working and being productive is the highest dopamine inducing activity at our disposal, and we will gravitate towards work.

**P.s.** This post is based on Neuroproductivity, which is NO-BS productivity (productivity using science) if you are interested I got this from moretimeoffline+com they only use productivity based on science for entrepreneurs, they have great free stuff there

Hope this helps! cheers :)"

fc29593c-d4b9-433a-be18-58a28dd2dd7b,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I’m writing this because I feel **completely lost** in my career right now. I’ve been stuck in my own head for months, overthinking every possible path I could take, and it’s driving me insane. **I need advice, fresh perspectives, and maybe even mentorship.**

I don’t really have anyone in my life right now who I can bounce ideas off or who can help me find some clarity. My best friend? Well, I’ll explain why that’s complicated. My wife and my mom are amazing, but they just don’t get the entrepreneurial side of things, even though they listen. So here I am, hoping that someone out there might understand what I’m going through.

# Context

I’m 24 years old, from Mexico, but I’ve been living abroad for a couple of years—currently in Russia because my wife is from here. My background is in **eCommerce, digital marketing, and project management**, and I’ve been working for myself for several years.

Right now, I have two main income streams:

1. **My own eCommerce business in Mexico**, which I built from scratch. It’s profitable, growing, and generates six figures annually.
2. A **B2B client** in the U.S. (a mid-sized financial/insurance company) that pays me to manage their campaigns, lead generation, CRM, etc. I work directly with their president, and I also have a couple of smaller clients, but they’re not stable income.

Financially, I’m stable. I have enough to live comfortably and reinvest. **Money isn’t the issue.** In fact, I could take more from my eCommerce business, but I keep my salary low to reinvest as much as possible.

**What worries me is that I don’t have a clear direction.**  
I don’t know where to invest my time, energy, or resources. I’m willing to put in the work, the money, the hours—but **into what?**

# The eCommerce dilemma

Here’s where things get complicated. I currently run an **eCommerce business in Mexico** with my best friend as my business partner. And while I respect our friendship, I’ve realized that **working together just doesn’t work.** I’ve felt disappointed and frustrated with how things have turned out, and I’ve already decided to **sell my share of the business ASAP.** That part is settled.

The real question is: **Do I even want to stay in eCommerce at all?**

Recently, I talked with my mom, and she’s willing to help me out as a legal proxy in Mexico. This opens the door to **start a new eCommerce business**, this time without a business partner. I could handle it remotely, she’d help with local logistics, and I’ve already decided to go ahead—**mostly to create some extra income and help her out financially.**

But here’s where my mind starts spinning:

* **Should I treat this new store as just a side hustle or the start of something bigger?**
* **Is it smart to keep doing eCommerce, or am I just clinging to what’s familiar?**
* **What’s wrong with having multiple businesses anyway?** I could build the store, take it from 0 to 1, automate it, hire people, and move on.

That sounds logical on paper.  
But deep down, **it doesn’t sit right.**

I believe in **focus**.  
I admire people who commit to a single vision, get obsessed with it, and build something huge over the years. **I want that.**

Starting another eCommerce store feels like a distraction from asking the real question:  
**What’s the one thing I actually want to build long-term?**

Plus, eCommerce itself has changed. **It’s getting harder for small businesses** to compete with giants like Amazon and direct-to-consumer brands from big manufacturers. And honestly, **I’m not sure I want to stay tied to an industry that depends so much on physical locations and logistics.**

Part of me thinks, *“It’s just business. Build it, automate it, and move on.”*

# The B2B opportunity

On the other side, there’s my **B2B client**—a mid-sized financial/insurance company in the U.S. I manage their campaigns, lead generation, CRM, and I work directly with their president, which puts me in a **unique position**. They’re my biggest client, and I know that if I ever presented a solid business idea related to their industry, they’d at least hear me out—**maybe even become my first customer.**

Sounds like an amazing opportunity, right?  
But here’s the thing:

* **I’m not a developer.**
* **I don’t have a background in finance or insurance**, beyond what I’ve learned from working with them.
* **And it has nothing to do with eCommerce,** which is where all my actual expertise lies.

In eCommerce, I found a **business model that works extremely well in Latin America**—one that not many companies use, which gave me a huge competitive advantage. I’ve even thought about **replicating that model in other countries**. I did a small test in **Spain**, and it **worked**.

But then I hit a wall.  
**I didn’t know how to handle the paperwork, legal requirements, and logistics to keep it going—at least, not without a local partner.**  
And that’s exactly what I’ve been trying to avoid.

Because here’s the thing: **I’m DONE with having business partners.**

I’ve tried multiple businesses with friends, colleagues, and acquaintances, and **it’s always the same story—partnership problems.**  
I don’t want founding partners anymore. **I want to build something on my own.**  
If I bring someone in, it’ll be because they genuinely bring value, not just because it’s convenient.

In almost every partnership I’ve had, **I was the one driving the business forward**, telling my partners what to do like they were employees. But if that’s the case, **why not just hire employees instead of giving away equity?**  
What’s worse is that **I was the one investing the money**, the one willing to work 80-hour weeks to make the project succeed...

That’s why I’ve been questioning everything:

* **Should I stick to eCommerce, even though it comes with all these limitations?**
* **Should I pivot to something like SaaS, where I can build a product that scales without physical operations or partners?**
* **Should I pivot to something completely new and different?**

Because that’s what I really want—**something with massive scalability** that becomes an **actual business**, not just a self-employed job.

**eCommerce is great** because people buy the product, not me. It’s scalable, automatable, and delegatable.  
But the issues are clear:

* **The need for local partners when expanding.**
* **The challenges of managing physical products and logistics.**
* **The dominance of giants like Amazon, making it harder for small brands.**

So maybe **SaaS is the answer?**  
It’s digital, scalable, and not tied to any location.  
But then I think:

* **I’ve never built a SaaS before.**
* **I’m not a developer.**
* **And I don’t even know what problem I’d solve with it.**

So here I am—**stuck in this loop.**

# Random thoughts I want to share

**What if I’m in the wrong country altogether?** My family life is great here in Russia because of my wife and her family. But professionally? **It feels like a mistake.** I don’t understand the market, the laws, the language. Sometimes I think, *“What if I’d moved somewhere like the EU or UAE instead?”*

**I even thought about flipping houses here in Russia.** That’s how desperate I’ve felt to find something new. But I have zero knowledge of the market, real estate, or how anything works here.

**I really want a mentor.** Not saying I expect to find one from this post, but seriously, **how do people even find mentors?** Everything I’ve done so far has been through intuition, books, and YouTube. That’s it. I just wish I had someone to talk to—someone who’s been through this before.

# Why I’m Writing This

Because I’m stuck. **Really stuck.**  
And I’ve been trying to figure it out on my own, but it’s not working.

I’m looking for:

* **Advice from people who’ve been here before.**
* **New perspectives on what I might be missing.**
* Maybe even **a bit of mentorship or guidance.**

Whatever I decide to do, **I’m willing to invest time, money, and effort.**  
I’m not afraid of the work—I just don’t know where to put that energy.

And since I believe in focus, I want to **commit to something**—even if I start small, I want to know it’s something I can grow over time.

# TL;DR:

* **24-year-old entrepreneur** from Mexico, living in Russia.
* Profitable **eCommerce business** (but leaving it soon) + big **B2B client** in the U.S.
* **Completely lost** about what to do next—eCommerce, SaaS, something new?
* **Tired of business partners,** want to build something on my own.
* **Considering a big pivot**—even thought about flipping houses in Russia, that’s how desperate I am, lol.
* **Want to find a mentor** but no clue where to start.
* **Looking for advice, new perspectives, and maybe even mentorship.**

If you’ve been here before—**how did you figure it out?**  
What would you do if you were in my position?"

cfbecab8-0179-4752-87e0-d8ba2872fa5e,Entrepreneur,"For context, I'm in a dilemma. You see, I dropped out of highschool to run a content business. However, content creation requires consistency and is by no means, *fast money*. 

And since I'm living in a household of backstabbing and backbiting, my energy to work gets drained most of the time. I tried a lot of emotional regulation practices and esoteric stuff on energy absorption of negative auras, but it seems that I've hit a stalemate; because the air has become so toxic that it feels like death itself, or the suffocation feeling of being strangled, which distracts my focus to grind on my bizz.

These are my family and neighboors making fun of me for choosing an unorthodox path to work at home, and the pressure and expectations feel too much to bare. It's starting to seem like I just need to get a high enough status job to get them off my back (*like an admin officer at the US Embassy*) and use status as a shield so their toxicity reduce and my energy reserves can be spent on my online business instead of being sucked into the environment's hazardous atmosphere. 

I had clearly misjudged my family. I thought they would have my back, which is why I dropped out, but their presence have turned into a major obstacle in my path. Their actions and outright passive aggressive hate proves contrary to whatever notions I previously had about *family* from watching the movies. 

I'm thinking of applying to status related jobs, but my qualifications are fucked since I'm a high school drop out. But the ONLY reason I'm thinking to do this is to REDUCE the toxicity of the family with a shield of sorts that blocks their negativity (*such as a STATUS buff that acts as a Shield, gained from a prestigious workplace*) so that my mind can be free to work on my online business. But then again, it takes more energy to apply to these places and even perform there. My goal is to conserve energy and reduce my family's toxicity from affecting me, hence the dilemma.

I honestly don't want a job since the bizz is slowly picking up. There's cashflow; but it's just not high enough to brag about in public.

Overall, I'm pretty much fucked. My naïvety has ended here; damn those idealistic family wholesome movies that acted as the basis of my delusions. 

For what its worth, my best of wishes to anyone else who faces something similar. I hope you fellas weazle your way out somehow, just as how I am trying to right now. ✌"

I have bootstrapped the build up until now by working with an acquaintance I’ve come to know over the years who owns a dev shop. The relationship has gone well until now, but the inefficiencies are becoming too glaringly obvious.

I am a functional founder, background in large scale system/application implementations and am seeing a need to bring another founder on who can handle the technical side. Depending on their skill sets, it could be anywhere from designing the tech architecture to coding the frontend, backend, or smart contracts. 

I have a 95% MVP with designs done for the next phase. Next phase will cost about $10k-$25k depending on what needs to be hired out.

How would you all go about finding a tech cofounder? 

I am going to EthDenver hoping to meet some people there so that’s 1 route I’ve gone. I also just started looking on Y Combinator.

My ideas for things to build don’t stop at this marketplace, I have other things too on the docket so any advice on selling a long term partnership beyond this initial idea would be welcome. 

Thanks!"

311d8ec6-02e7-489b-a6f0-746eb03013a6,Entrepreneur,"For over 10 years, I have mastered the art of being a wantrepreneur, perfecting the skill of not taking action. 

Now I’m ready to share my expertise on how not to take action.

The most crucial first step is finding the perfect business idea. You should always start with an idea.

Don’t worry about what problem you are solving at this stage or who you are going to solve it for.

To make sure your idea is good enough, talk to your friends, family, people close to you. 

The closer, the better. Find people who already support you in life.

After talking and not taking action, if you still have some willpower left inside you, now it’s time to find the perfect name for your business.

Your business name means everything. If it’s not perfect, no one will buy your product or services. 

If you made it to this step, now you need a logo. A business without a logo is like a ship without a sail.

You get the idea. You can apply this same principle to your landing page, your co-founder, your MVP…

Make sure everything is perfect and ignore any negative feedback. 

Remember, you could always fail and you might not be 100% ready for it at this stage of your life. 

Maybe you should first find your true purpose in life."

**Problem-First, Product-Second** – The best startups don’t start with an idea; they start with a validated pain point. 90% of failed startups built solutions looking for a problem. Solve something painful, and the market will pay.

**Outcome-Based Pricing** – Customers pay for results, not fancy features. AI-driven and B2B startups are shifting to value-based pricing (e.g., charging per conversion, transaction, or saved time) instead of flat SaaS fees.

**Bootstrapping Wins (At Least Early On)** – VC money is great, but many founders are delaying fundraising to build traction first. With capital efficiency at an all-time high, profitable startups get the best deals.

**Community-Led Growth** – More than ever, successful startups are built with their users, not just for them. Founders leveraging Twitter, LinkedIn, and direct customer conversations are finding better PMF faster.

The concept that I am strugging with is that the 401k needs to purchase shares in the company to accomplish the ROBS objective of funding the business from your 401k, and to do this you need to have some kind of valuation of the company in order to price the shares correctly.  

How does one decide on a value for a company that has been created, but has done literally nothing else yet (because it needs that initial funding to start)?"

They have cleaning contracts that gross anywhere between $18,000 to $96,000. 

For example: There’s a cleaning contract  that gross $96,000 a year, they’re selling it for $25,000.. or you can put $18,000 down and finance the remaining balance of $7500… 42 payments of $226.90. 

It also says that business fees including: Royalty: 10% ( don’t know what this quite mean) Administration fee: 7%  and insurance fee: 8% .. so this equals out to 25% deducted from the contract grossing amount.

eede8927-5fd3-4593-a9cd-7a7411b2af98,Entrepreneur,"I think we can all agree- online business isn’t always sunshine and instant sales. Some days, things are slow. You put in the work, create content, tweak your strategies, and… nothing. I’ve been there more times than I can count. And honestly? It used to mess with my head.

At first, I’d spiral into thoughts like, *Did I do something wrong? Is this even working? Maybe I should just stop.* But over time, I learned that slow days (or even slow weeks) are just part of the journey. It’s not a sign to quit—it’s a sign to adjust, learn, and keep going.

Here’s how I deal with setbacks without letting them throw me off track:

1. I remind myself that this is **NORMAL.** No business—online or offline—has a perfect track record of daily sales. Even the biggest brands have slow seasons. Understanding this helped me stop taking it personally.
2. I **focus** on my long-term vision**.** If I let one slow day define my entire business, I’d never make it past the first few months. I remind myself why I started, what my bigger goal is, and that one dip in sales doesn’t erase all the progress I’ve made.
3. I use slow periods to **sharpen my strategy.** Instead of panicking, I analyze. Am I reaching the right audience? Is my messaging clear? Do I need to switch up my content strategy? Sometimes, all it takes is a small tweak to start seeing movement again.
4. I **double down** on **VALUE.** When sales slow down, I don’t disappear—I show up even more. I create helpful content, engage with my audience, and remind people why what I offer is valuable. Selling isn’t just about pushing offers; it’s about building trust and relationships.
5. I remember that **business is a cycle**. The online space moves fast. What feels like a “low” moment today could shift in an instant. A single post, a new strategy, or even just staying consistent can turn things around.

The truth is, setbacks used to scare me. Now, I see them as a chance to grow. If you’re in a slow season right now, keep going. Keep showing up, keep learning, and trust that the work you’re putting in will pay off.

For those wondering what my business is all about—I sell digital products and mentor people looking to build online income streams. Whether it’s affiliate marketing, selling digital products, or learning how to monetize content, I help simplify the process so you don’t have to figure it all out alone.

If you’ve ever had a slow period in your business, how did you handle it?"

836e3dc7-8156-48f5-a668-03b3c737860e,Entrepreneur,"Like everyone else starting a brand, I was super excited. I have learned that building a clothing brand takes a lot from you, but it’s a super fun journey if you stick to it. I’ve picked up some lessons that would’ve saved me a lot of stress. I wanted to share some of these lessons with the community.

If you’re in the early stages, here are some things I wish I knew:

**Your brand is supposed to represent something bigger than yourself.** It’s about the experience from the moment your customer shops from you, to delivery, to actually wearing it. It’s about the whole shopping experience and how the specific product makes the customer feel when wearing it. You always want to increase their social status. Your customer wants to feel part of a community.

**Don’t wait until everything is perfect.** I wasted a ton of time trying to perfect everything before launching the brand. Just start and learn as you go. This will make the journey a lot more fun because you’ll improve faster.

**Your manufacturer needs to make your life easier, not the other way around.** I tried out several manufacturers before I finally found the correct one. Don’t settle on this one, as your brand deserves a manufacturer that is professional and gives you the service you deserve to make you and your customers happy. (I know this one is always a pain in the butt for many clothing brand owners)

**Social media is built to create a community, utilize it.** Social media has been a game changer for online businesses for quite a long time now, and it won’t stop. Use it to create a community that people want to follow. Don’t just sell to make money, sell to provide for the community. You will see sales come naturally this way.

**Keeping customers & constantly finding new ones.** Repeat customers are gold. Focus on giving them such a great experience that they want to come back. Also make sure to focus on getting new ones, and repeat the process.

Excited to see what you guys think of this!"

c0695e46-c5ea-47af-92b8-54e525500b57,Entrepreneur,"I just got off a call with a prospect yesterday, didn’t end up closing the deal but the reason behind why the prospect told me it wouldn't work was mind-baffling to me. 

For some context, I’m a 20-year-old entrepreneur who’s been in business for around 6-7 years (since I was 13). I’ve had a few successful ventures, and way more unsuccessful ones, but those ups and downs gave me the knowledge and confidence I have now. I run a 6 figure service-based business, and I’m comfortable talking to clients big or small because I’ve done it many times.

Yesterday, I hopped on a discovery call myself (usually my front-end team does these) because this prospect was a “whale” in my eyes (a major opportunity). So there I am, in the flow of the conversation, identifying pain points, laying out solutions, all that good stuff. In my head I’m thinking, “Bro, I’m killing this, there's no way I don’t close her.” By the end of the call, she seemed really motivated, even complimenting me on how articulate I was. But then she dropped the bomb: the only thing making her hesitate was my **age**.

I was honestly shocked. It had never even occurred to me that my age could be such a big deal, I always thought it was beneficial if anything, especially since I’ve worked with bigger clients before, and it never came up. I’m curious, has anyone else here faced rejection (or at least skepticism) purely because you’re on the younger side?

If so, how did you feel? How did you handle it?

I’m still wrapping my head around this, because on one hand, age shouldn’t matter if you can deliver results, right? But apparently, for some prospects, it does. Would love to hear your stories or advice.

I'm not stressed about this as this was only 1 client out of many but I’m curious to hear any thoughts.

Also if you're a young entrepreneur or just an entrepreneur in general I’d love to connect and network with you. Network = Networth and I truly believe that."
80e63ae0-6fad-4452-8313-d66275e0aef1,Entrepreneur,"# How My Ego Cost Me a fortune !!

Last week, I wrote about how I landed my biggest client. (Link in the first comment). Today, I want to share a different story—one without a happy ending, but full of lessons.

📅 **2020, deep into the pandemic.** My business was struggling, so I decided to launch a new company focused on energy efficiency. It seemed like a no-brainer: saving the planet while saving clients money. Who wouldn't want that?

I raised funds from *Friends & Family*, used our savings, and went all in. I ignored advice to wait because my ego told me I would prove them wrong.

We quickly secured a presentation with **7-Eleven**, including top executives from Mexico and the UK. We were selected for a pilot program for energy monitoring and efficiency. **The final contract was for 1,800 stores over four years.**

💡 **Here’s where I made my first mistake:** Instead of accepting their request to test 2 stores, I volunteered to test 4. **For free.**

But *everything seemed fine.* We did a great job, exceeded expectations, and gained recognition from both the client and our suppliers. My ego skyrocketed.

After months of work, **our results were outstanding**. We saved more energy than expected, outperformed three competitors, and tied with another. We were **certain** we’d win.

📉 **But we didn’t.**

We couldn’t understand what went wrong. Everything pointed to us closing the deal. But we didn’t.

By that time, we had spent too much. Plus, I had **put all my eggs in one basket**, neglecting other opportunities to focus on this deal.

# Lessons Learned

1️⃣ **Ego clouds judgment.** Never make business decisions to prove others wrong.  
2️⃣ **Scale gradually.** Big business relationships rarely happen overnight. Start small and grow.  
3️⃣ **Learn to say NO.** No matter how big the opportunity, know your limits.  
4️⃣ **Free work is NOT a strategy.** Clients won’t value your business if you give away work.  
5️⃣ **Measure your risks.** Business isn’t gambling. Sustainable growth beats *all-in* bets.  
6️⃣ **Listen and read the signs.** The warnings I ignored were right, but my ego blinded me.  
7️⃣ **Don’t make strategic decisions when emotionally compromised.** You’ll prioritize what *feels* good (ego) over what’s best for the business.  
8️⃣ **Don’t fall for “false success.”** Followers, applause, and people impressed by your progress don’t mean you’re actually succeeding. Don’t mistake social validation for real results.

I hope my story helps someone avoid the same mistakes. Have you ever experienced something similar?"
1630f601-da47-4f50-9208-3e8ca689ff6d,Entrepreneur,"**TL;DR:** Don't get ripped off for software—there’s usually a simpler, cheaper way to build what you need.

I started teaching myself to code when I was 12. Somehow, 20 years later, I’m still at it, calling myself a software engineer. I started back when PHP ruled the web, watched JavaScript take over, and worked on AI when it was mostly useless outside of niche applications. Now, I find myself no longer part of the newest wave of programmers – which is still a weird realization.

Along the way, I struggled a lot with mental health. I used to believe I could fix the world with software. I knew it was unrealistic, but it still took me 10 years to fully let that idea go. And honestly, I have a lot of compassion for my younger self – it's tough watching the world burn and feeling powerless to help.

I spent years trying to build things that I thought would have a big impact. I got really good at prototyping, but I lacked business sense. I’d build an MVP, hit business obstacles, and then jump to a new project instead of pushing through. Took me a while to realize that obstacles aren’t a sign to stop – that’s just how the game is played.

Because of this, I’ve worked with a lot of different technologies: Scala, Java, Python, R, React Native, Redux, RxJS, Play Framework, Tomcat, Nginx, WebSockets, zsh and bash scripting, PHP, F#, C#, Haskell, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, V, IPFS, phone and SMS systems, JavaScript image manipulation, and more that I’ve probably forgotten.

I was deep into AI before it was widely useful – SOMs, SVMs, Boltzmann machines, LSTMs, convolutional networks, genetic algorithms, Markov chains, decision trees.

These days, my stack is much simpler (wisdom of the years kicking in): JavaScript, Express.js, and htmx. This lets me build complex web apps without needing a separate frontend. I also use my own hin.js library to keep things structured and avoid spaghetti code.

I have a love-hate relationship with software. On one hand, I can build almost anything with it, and it’s supported my family for years. On the other hand, the endless sitting, screen time, nonsensical bugs, and constantly learning knowledge that I’ll use once and forget can get frustrating.

But what I do love is teaching. And right now feels like the perfect time for it—so many tools have made programming, prototyping, and MVP building more accessible than ever. Part of me worries that my career will become irrelevant, but a bigger part of me is just excited that more people can use the magic of software to bring their ideas to life.

So, ask me anything—whether it’s about choosing the right tech for your MVP, avoiding costly mistakes, or just random curiosities about software and tech. Happy to share whatever I can!"

1. All businesses need a 80/20 marketing/PR budget. Oddly enough, good PR can create marketing like results such as sales/leads/traffic. Marketing cannot create PR. (because this is Reddit, there will be one dildo in comments that says something stupid like, ""My uncle's cousin got a news interview because of his Facebook ads, HACK."" Sure Ricky, Ill bet he beat up his drill instructor too.)

2. If you have a niche, you can find magazines and blogs that are devoted to your section of this industry. They are EASIER to get placement in, the more specific you  are.

3. Making a reporter database is worth the time and effort, you just need some research hours.

4. Your news coverage will come from a good pitch, the top 4 I use are: Subject matter expert, live demonstration, current events, or achievement. 

5. Chase PR that matches your business model. A newspaper in Tennessee is worthless if you are a dog walker in Santa Barbara. The ONLY exception is if you use it for your as featured on branding. 

6. Forbes is dogshit. Stay far away. 

7. Any PR pro you hire, needs to have past client results and a refund or non performance policy. 

Hope this helps. Any PR questions? "

I bought a domain (spaciousmind.store) and started a very basic website on shopify, with plans to upgrade my website and improve product photos and listings etc. but haven't found the time to really focus on that yet so it's still pretty bare bones. Most of my t-shirt sales are in person at events etc. I have a pretty distinct style and a niche audience, which tends to work well for me in bigger urban centers (wellington area) but doesn't go down well in smaller/rural areas.  
The grant money has run out now and I'm struggling, I need to find another job on the side to keep me afloat, so that will require a bit of a focus shift. I want to continue to build this thing and realistically online is the best way to do it.  


So this brings me to my dilemma now, I'm paying about $29USDp/m for this stupid shopify store that I haven't really been utilising properly. They took away the option for me to use the starter plan.   
I want to keep an online storefront but know I need to invest time in upgrading and promoting/marketing it and I can't do that straight away. 

I see bigCartel have much more affordable prices. I think it can still do everything that I need.  
I'm just wondering about taking payments in person, right now I have a stripe wisepad3 reader which is linked to the shopify POS so keeps track of all my inventory.  shopify take 2% or something on every sale.  
I need to make sure I can still sell in person. Is there a POS that comes with the bigCartel plan that I can use with my wisepad3 ?

Any experience you guys have had with bigCartel would be helpful here!  
cheers :)"

I'm not looking for general advice on franchising; rather, I want to know how much money someone might make from operating any particular brand.

I have written over 500 titles on YouTube (longs & shorts) ""i was a shorts strategist before becoming a longs strategist - 2 yrs experience"" and generated over 200 million views.

Every time i write titles or brainstorm ideas, i always lean into an emotional hook AND not be vague ""target an audience/topic"". - ""if you create content for all, you're creating for no one.""

Here's how to stop writing boring generic EDUCATIONAL YouTube titles...

(the example provided - ""productivity"" niche)

\[Ali Abdaal, Nischa, Codie Sanchez, Alex Hormozi, Iman Gadzhi...etc\]

# 10 emotional hooks drive curiosity in YouTube titles for people to click/watch:

# 1. Contrarian (Challenging the Norm)

People love when something flips their beliefs upside down. It forces them to **rethink what they thought they knew**, making them want to click and “fact-check” the claim.

❌ *How to Be More Productive* → (Generic, expected)  
✅ *Why Productivity Hacks Are Ruining Your Focus* → (Challenges a common belief)

# 2. Loss Aversion (Fear of Missing Out or Avoiding Mistakes)

People are wired to **avoid loss** more than they seek gains. A title that suggests **they’re making a mistake** or **falling behind** makes them anxious to know why.

❌ *How to Stay Focused at Work* → (Too broad, no emotional weight)  
✅ *If You Work Like This, You’re Wasting Hours Every Day* → (Creates urgency & fear of lost time)

# 3. Unfinished Loops (Curiosity Gaps)

Leaving something unanswered makes people *need* to know the missing piece. This works because **our brains hate unfinished stories**.

❌ *How I Stopped Procrastinating* → (Too straightforward)  
✅ *The Weird Trick That Killed My Procrastination Instantly* → (Teases a surprising solution)

# 4. Shock & Surprise (Breaking Expectations)

Titles that **subvert expectations** make people curious about *how* or *why* something happened.

❌ *My 5-Step Focus System* → (Sounds generic)  
✅ *I Stopped Using To-Do Lists—Here’s What Happened* → (Challenges common advice)

# 5. Relatability & Identity (Speaking to a Specific Audience)

People click when they feel like the video **is made for them**. A title that speaks to **their unique experience or struggles** will always perform better.

❌ *How to Focus Better* → (Too broad)  
✅ *If You're Easily Distracted, Here’s How to Finally Fix It* → (Speaks to a specific problem)

# 6. Status & Superiority (Positioning the Viewer as Smarter/Better)

People want to feel like **they’re ahead of the curve**. A title that suggests they’re missing out on key knowledge **challenges their self-perception**, making them want to prove themselves.

❌ *How the Most Productive People Work* → (Informative but bland)  
✅ *5 Productivity Habits of The Top 1%* → (Implies exclusivity)

# 7. Mystery & Hidden Knowledge (Secrets & Forbidden Topics)

People **crave exclusive information**, especially when it feels like something “they” don’t want you to know.

❌ *How to Work Smarter, Not Harder* → (Generic)  
✅ *The Dark Side of Productivity No One Talks About* → (Feels controversial & revealing)

# 8. Transformation & Before/After (Journey & Change)

People love **before-and-after stories** because they want to see **if they can achieve the same result**.

❌ *The Best Focus Tips* → (Informative, but bland)  
✅ *How I Went from Working 6 Hours to 2 Hours (and Got More Done)* → (Suggests an extreme, desirable shift)

# 9. Urgency & Scarcity (Limited Time or Rare Info)

When something **feels time-sensitive**, people are more likely to click because they fear **missing out**.

❌ *The Best Books on Productivity* → (Plain)  
✅ *5 Productivity Books You Need to Read Before 2025* → (Adds a deadline)

# 10. Controversy & Drama (Polarizing Topics)

Strong opinions get clicks—even if people **disagree**, they’ll engage.

❌ *Pros and Cons of Hustle Culture* → (Balanced but uninteresting)  
✅ *Hustle Culture is a Scam—Here’s Why* → (Emotionally charged stance)"

5. Affiliate Marketing (no product at all)

I started an auto dealership last year and lost $50k in that business endeavor. I gained a lot of experience at the cost of $50k. But at the end of the day, the used car business didn’t align with my moral compass and I decided to pivot my businesses direction. 

At the beginning of the year I transitioned to a auto repair shop since me and my partner each have 10+ years experience and worked on all of our own car lot vehicles and have done repairs on the side for years, this made the most since. 

We’ve only been a full time repair shop since the beginning of the year and have started to build traction in our customer base. But still didn’t break even last month and honestly I just feel stuck. I’m going to persevere until we succeed. 

I know everyone says that “comparison is the thief of joy”.

But man at times it just really weighs on me and makes starting and growing this business challenging. 

What advice would others give to stay focused during these times to see the light at the end of the tunnel?

New to this sub. My name is Sarvesh and I am a performance marketer by profession, till last year I was doing job with UK based company where I used to generate leads for lots of different clients of my company. Last year the company shut down its business and I thought I would try something on my own. During my job I used to work with small local US businesses as well like Beauty Spa, Nail Salon, Med Spa etc and I used to help them get more customers (customers who would pay deposit in advance in some cases). During my job I realized that these small businesses rely a lot on Google reviews but they were struggling to get reviews even though they had really good service. This gave me an idea about to create a system where I can help these small businesses to get Google genuine reviews. I really think there is a market for such honest service. I want to give it a try but I am struggling  to find first few clients. I am willing to work for free for few businesses so that I can test my system and so that I can get some feedback. Feedback on how I can improve my system and also advice on what can be the right pricing to charge. I have dropped messages to my friends and family and I have also put post on LinkedIn as well but I haven't been able to get anyone :(

I am offering genuine Google reviews for free. The business has nothing to lose. Anyone got some ideas how I can go about it?

i have the feeling that most business owners do not care about aesthetics. and i know, roi, money, ...

of course, but the fundamental - you create for people, people prefer pretty stuff, over ugly. why don't we create nicer, prettier products, websites, apps, ads. i really know that some budgets are tight, but i also know that those investments pay off.

most likely you have to pay someone to create banners, graphics, websites, for you. i am in the web development field. we create websites. today, anyone can do it, that's right. but getting something done is one thing, doing it correctly is another one. i make sure to make it nicer, faster and more search engine friendly, so most likely 20% more expensive investment will bring you much more overtime. **and that applies to everything**, as far as i know - designs, graphics, ads. that's interesting, because everyone wants crazy profit margins, but no one is willing to invest to get that.

am i wrong? would be happy to confront with your arguments."

9bdc3ffc-7736-4c0e-9f6e-16878afa4b9c,Entrepreneur,"I worked a corporate job at a Big 4 consulting firm for about 4 years fresh out of Uni and although I was a top performer, I hated it. So.. I decided to quit and try my own thing. I really couldn't continue. I know ppl say "" build your side hustle before quiting"" but I had no time or energy or emotional bandwidth while I was working as a legal consultant. I was seriously considering taking my own life. 

Originally, I wanted to build and sell software targeted to people in my legal field. But, after reading some books about entrepreneurship, I realized I probably should build some sort of audience first and see if there is actually any interest in what I had planned before investing time and money into an idea. So i decided to work freelance first to build up a client base that could evenetually buy something like software from me, also to understand my target's problems and if what I had in mind would actually benefit them. I got a few small freelance projects but clients wanted to pay pennies for months of work. Although I always got very good testimonals after I finished my work. I realized that I needed to prove my value to attract higher ticket clients. I am confident about the quality of my work, but of course other people who never worked with me cannot have the same confidence and therefore pick me over someone else who offers the same for a cheaper price... I offered to work for free for several  companies who I know are likely Big 4 clients to prove my worth and the quality of my work (before charging anything) I never got any responses with this cold outreach, and I'd spend hours a day researching these companies to send cold emails showing I knew about their business and the issues they faced. Because this didn't work and freelance jobs weren't paying very well, I decided to start a weekly newsletter to show my knowledge and I post free tools every week. I've continued applying to freelance jobs on Upwork. 

It's been six weeks since i started my newsletter and no bites. At the end of every newsletter I mention that I am working freelance and provide a link to book a free first consultation with me... no bites. I have 72 subscribers to my free newsletter now, i post it on LinkedIn. I've also tried to sell small ticket items (e.g., templates for a few buck) but not one purchase. 

It has been 6 months since I started and I've made about 1,000 bucks TOTAL.  I've always lived very modestly and so I can survive for a long time off my savings.. but I'm starting to feel a little hopeless and I'm wondering if I can get some advice. I really don't want to go back to corporate life.

Ever had one of those moments where you wake up and think, *“What if I built something completely random just for fun?”* That’s exactly what happened to me (and my friend, Sam) this past weekend. We wanted to create a **web product**from scratch in **under 48 hours**. But here’s the twist: **our only goal is to make exactly $1**. Not $10, not $1,000, definitely not $1,000,000 just $1, a single buck.

# Why Only $1?

* **Low Pressure, High Fun**: When there’s not a massive financial target, the stress levels stay low. We can focus on being creative and silly.
* **Quick Validation**: Earning even a tiny amount proves that someone, somewhere, values what we made. And if they’ll pay one dollar, maybe we’re onto something that can evolve later.
* **Pure Experimentation**: It’s a mini-lab for testing ideas, building fast, and learning from mistakes—without the usual startup hype.

# The 48-Hour Challenge

# A Strict Timeframe

We gave ourselves exactly 48 hours to go from “random idea” to “live product” on the web. That meant:

* **No endless brainstorming**. We had to pick an idea fast.
* **No over-engineering**. Only the simplest version (MVP) would get done in time.
* **No second-guessing**. If we messed up, we pivoted quickly or embraced the chaos.

# The Actual Product

We ended up creating a small platform called **StakeGod** essentially a fun way for people to set personal challenges or bets, hold themselves accountable, and have a little “skin in the game.” The entire premise is that you pick a challenge for yourself (or for a friend), stake something on it, and share progress publicly so others can follow along.

But remember, our bigger mission: **Make $1**. That’s it. If even one person out there pays for something on this site, we’re doing a happy dance and calling it a success.

# How We Pulled It Off

1. **Rapid-Fire Brainstorm**: We spent the first couple of hours swapping ideas over coffee. We wanted something we’d personally use something that’s not serious but can still be helpful.
2. **MVP Mindset**: We asked ourselves, *“What is the absolute minimum we need for this idea to work?”* We cut out everything else. This kept the scope tiny.
3. **Divide & Conquer**: Sam handled the quick design layout (we went with a super simple style), while I tackled the basic functionality. We used lightweight tools and open-source resources whenever possible.
4. **Launch & Share**: With almost no time left, we deployed a functioning version. Then we told a few friends, posted on social media, and started holding our breath.

# Lessons Learned Along the Way

* **Speed Sparks Creativity**: Knowing we only had 48 hours lit a fire under us to solve problems quickly. You can’t fall into “analysis paralysis” if the clock is ticking.
* **Tiny Goals Are Still Goals**: Why chase $1M right away if $1 can prove your idea has legs? Every big success starts with the smallest possible step.
* **Embracing Imperfection**: Our product is *far* from perfect. But getting something out there beats waiting forever for the “perfect moment.”
* **Fun is Fuel**: We realized we hadn’t laughed this much while coding in ages. Doing something just for the thrill of it feels pretty refreshing.

# A Historical Nod

This approach reminds me of the early days of **Apple** or **Microsoft**, where Steve Jobs or Bill Gates weren’t trying to raise billions immediately. They started in garages, building “small.” Their initial profits (if any) were modest, but the excitement of *making something real* fueled them to keep going.

# Why This Might Interest You

If you’re reading this on **Entrepreneur** or **Startup**, you’ve probably seen countless posts about raising VC money, developing complicated SaaS, or scaling to seven figures. That’s all cool, but sometimes, **it’s fun to go the opposite route**: set a playful, almost absurd goal, and see what you can do in a short time frame.

* **You don’t need big budgets** to launch.
* **You don’t need endless months** of planning.
* **You don’t need everything** to be perfect before showing people.

Maybe this could inspire you to start your own wacky micro-project: 72 hours to build a digital zine, 24 hours to design a new board game, 1 week to create a simple mobile app. The timescale and the smallness of the goal can kickstart your creativity more than you’d expect.

# The Path Forward

Are we going to stop once we hit $1? Probably not. If it happens and we see any excitement around the product, we might add new features or refine what’s there. But if no one cares or if we only get 50 cents it’ll still be worth it for the experience, the laughs, and the story.

One big takeaway: **even if an idea is half-baked, launching it can teach you more than just thinking about it**. Worst case scenario, you spent two days on a fun project. Best case scenario, you find something people truly love and create a stepping stone for bigger things.

# How You Can Follow or Help

* **Check It Out**: If you’re curious, see how it all turned out at stakegod. Maybe you’ll be the first to throw in a dollar and help us meet our silly goal.
* **Ask Us Anything**: Drop a comment below if you want details on the build, design choices, or lessons learned. We’re an open book.
* **Start Your Own Timer**: If you’re feeling inspired, consider giving yourself 48 hours to make something no matter how trivial and see where it leads. Then share your story here on Reddit too.

# TL DR

* We built a web product, **StakeGod**, in **48 hours**.
* Our only goal: **earn $1**.
* Why? Because it’s fun, forces quick creativity, and proves small wins can be incredibly motivating.

**Thanks for reading**, this was a blast to make. We hope it gives you a smile, maybe an idea for your own mini-project, or at least a moment to think, “Hey, sometimes small goals rock.” Feel free to share your thoughts, feedback, or your own quick-launch success (or failure) stories!

# Final Thoughts

Building something fast and aiming low might sound counterintuitive in a world of venture-backed unicorn dreams, but it’s surprisingly liberating. We encourage anyone who’s been stuck in brainstorming mode to **pick a tiny target** and **just go for it**. You might be surprised by what you learn about building, marketing, and yourself.

Thanks again for stopping by, and best of luck on all your 48-hour (or longer!) ventures!"

Hi All, 

I've been lurking here for awhile and looking for some help for a business idea that I'm looking at developing.  Concept is simple, I'm looking at creating a job search for contractors/freelancers for a specific niche market.

I'm looking for an off the shelf product that enables me to run a similar service to freelancing sites, but with a few key scope items.

1. Job and Candidate Searching/matching
2. Provide rating system similar to freelance., fiver etc.,
3. The ability to send time sensitive alerts to contractors who meet the requirements of the scope of work. E.g. sms/email alerts
4. Ability to support and store documents such as certificates and reports of valid certifications, legal docs etc.,
5. Payment processing e.g. handle payment services for both parties. and the ability to take a % fee.
6. Must meet data privacy requirements (GDPR etc.,)

If someone can point me in the right direction, that would be great, as I would rather buy something tested and feature rich over paying a small fortune for something to be made.

 Thanks"

One of the biggest reasons startups fail isn’t a lack of a great product—it’s a lack of planning, execution, and adaptability. We worked with an app startup from its early days, helping with business planning, market research, and strategic growth, ultimately leading to 1M+ users. Here’s what we learned and what every business (especially apps) should focus on.

**1. A Business Plan is Non-Negotiable**

Many founders treat business plans as a box to check, but a well-structured plan is a roadmap to success. It’s not just about impressing investors—it’s about forcing clarity on your strategy. Key elements every business plan should have:
	
•	Problem & Solution – Clearly define the problem you’re solving. If you can’t summarize your value in a sentence, it’s too complicated.
	
•	Unique Value Proposition (UVP) – What makes you different from competitors? A small edge isn’t enough—you need a clear differentiation.
	
•	Go-To-Market Strategy – How will you acquire your first 1,000 users or customers? Organic growth? Paid ads? Influencers? Partnerships?
	
•	Monetization Model – What are your revenue streams? Subscriptions, one-time purchases, freemium models? Most startups underestimate customer acquisition costs and overestimate willingness to pay.
	
•	Financial Projections – A rough estimate of revenue vs. costs. If you’re burning money too fast, even the best idea can fail before it gains traction.

Key takeaway: Your business plan should be a living document that evolves as you get more data—not something you create once and forget.

**2. Market Research is More Than Just Checking Competitors**

Most startups make dangerous assumptions about their market. Instead of just looking at competitors, we:
	
•	Conducted direct user interviews to understand pain points—no guessing, just real feedback.
	
•	Analyzed search trends & behavior data to see what users are actually looking for, not just what competitors are offering.
	
•	Tested different pricing models & features through surveys, fake landing pages, and A/B tests before full development.
	
•	Looked at competitor gaps, not just strengths—what are customers complaining about in reviews? That’s an opportunity.

Key takeaway: A “good idea” isn’t enough—you need data-backed validation to ensure demand. The best businesses solve urgent problems that people are already searching for solutions to.

**3. Marketing Isn’t Just Ads—It’s Positioning, Retention & Virality**

A big mistake we see: Startups burn money on ads before fixing their retention problem. Here’s what worked instead:
	
•	Positioning & Messaging – Before spending a cent on ads, we refined the core message to make it instantly clear why users should care. Confusing messaging = wasted ad spend.
	
•	Referral & Viral Loops – We incentivized users to invite friends, rewarding them with in-app perks. If 1 user brings 2, growth is exponential.
	
•	Community & Social Proof – We engaged with early users in online communities (Reddit, Discord, niche Facebook groups), making them feel like part of the brand, not just customers.
	
•	Content Marketing & Thought Leadership – Instead of just running ads, we created valuable content that positioned the brand as an industry authority. Trust converts better than discounts.

Key takeaway: Marketing isn’t just about acquiring users—it’s about keeping them and making them bring others. Growth comes from a mix of product experience + strong messaging + strategic distibution.

**4. Growth Requires the Right Metrics (Not Just Vanity Metrics)**

Many founders obsess over vanity metrics (likes, downloads) instead of the numbers that actually matter. Here’s what we tracked instead:
	•	User Retention & Churn Rate – How many users are still active after 30 days? A high churn rate means you’re filling a leaky bucket—fix the product before spending more on marketing.
	•	Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) vs. Lifetime Value (LTV) – Are you making more from each user than you spend to acquire them? Many businesses don’t realize they’re scaling at a loss.
	•	Activation Rate – What percentage of new users take a meaningful action (like making a purchase or completing a key step)? If people sign up but don’t engage, something’s broken.
	•	Conversion Funnel Optimization – We A/B tested everything from onboarding screens to CTA buttons, because small tweaks can make or break conversion rates .

Key takeaway: Scale isn’t just about acquiring users—,it’s about ensuring they stay, engage, and convert profitably.

**Final Thoughts—**



Having a great product is just step one. The difference between startups that succeed and those that fail isn’t just fundingit’s strategy, execution, and constant iteration.

That’s what they told us.

When we set out to build ELSA AI—the world’s first AI-powered Influencer Marketing Assistant—people said:

❌ ""AI can’t understand influencer marketing.""

❌ ""Finding the right influencer takes human intuition.""

❌ ""Brands and influencers don’t need AI.""

But here’s what we knew:

💡 Brands were wasting hours manually searching for the right influencers.

💡 Influencers were struggling to land high-value collaborations.

💡 Campaigns were failing because data wasn’t being used effectively.

So we built ELSA AI—not just another tool, but a revolution. 

👉 AI that discovers the right influencer for your brand in seconds.

👉 AI that optimizes campaigns for better ROI—no more guessing.

👉 AI that automates tedious workflows, so you can focus on what matters.

For the past year, I’ve been having this idea of starting a blog focused on small business growth and entrepreneurship. I’ve been a business owner for 8 years now, and my journey has had a lot of ups and downs which I learned a LOT from.

I started by buying a failing small business doing just $190K in revenue for $125K. Back then, it had one employee and was barely making $25K in profit. Fast forward 8 years, and I’ve scaled to two businesses generating $1.7M in revenue, with 18 employees and $500K-$600K in profit.

But it wasn’t easy. I faced tons of struggles like COVID and liquidity problems. But along the way I learned so much! From hiring and onboarding employees to improving operations and expenses, implementing growth strategies, and turning around a failing business.

So why not share everything I’ve learned?  
I want to break down real-world experiences, strategies, and mistakes to help other small business owners and entrepreneurs grow.

Do you think a blog like this would be interesting to read? I'm thinking about staying anonymous so I can share all the details about the numbers: expenses, profit margins, etc etc

Would you think there is a lot of interest in stories and lessons like this? My goal isn’t to monetize it heavily but if I can build a community where business owners can help each other that would be awesome!

Would love to hear your thoughts! Appreciate any feedback "

I have a unique challenge as an entrepreneur, and I'd love to hear your insights.I’m a small business owner in Paris, working mainly in media—photography and videography. Originally from Israel, I’ve been living here for 15 years.

Until October 2023, my clientele was evenly split between Israelis and a mix of French and international clients. But after the war between Israel and Gaza started, my business took a 90% hit overnight. While Israeli clients are slowly returning (though not at previous levels), rebuilding the foreign market has been much harder. Now, most new clients come only through direct recommendations, and cold outreach feels nearly impossible.

At one point, I even started looking for an office job, but I get the feeling my background may be working against me. How do people know? My CV mentions Hebrew, and my website is multilingual, including Hebrew. In today’s climate, that alone seems to carry unintended baggage.

I’ve tried branching out, as some suggested before, but it hasn’t worked. I feel like I have to downplay or even hide my identity just to be judged on my skills rather than assumptions about where I come from. It’s frustrating because I just want my work to speak for itself.

How do you refocus the conversation on your value rather than what people *think* your background represents?

Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance!"
30341bc6-a4ea-4fc3-a355-72814bd1259c,Entrepreneur,"I recently restarted a business I had that was going pretty well but I ran into some logistics issues and i gave it up before restarting around Christmas last year. For context the business is centred around renewing the tradition of jam and jelly making by using high end/exotic ingredients, and I have really high ambitions for this because I know I have a competitive advantage in knowing how to make really good products in this niche and I have pretty solid demand validation (at the scale I’m currently working at. 

The thing is that I’ve had to go through a lot of anxiety in trying to make recipes that I couldn’t for the life of me figure out, source for materials that felt unfindable resulting in me chasing dead ends for hours, and worrying whether my products would turn out the way I want. I’d say by all measures things turned out well, as I’ve received great feedback and have return customers, but on the flip side I feel like I only really have business from family friends and people that I’m directly connected to which makes me feel like I might be delusional in how the average person would perceive my products. 

I also find a lot of angst in trying to visualise how I can scale to the degree that I aim for, and I’m not sure if the market for my products will really sustain my ambitions. With such a “different” product compared to others in my niche I’m afraid it would be hard to scale, for example when I imagine trying to make just 100k I’d have to sell something like 1000 jars a month? I’m not sure it’s possible and as a result I feel a bit run down about giving it my all. 

Would like to ask if anyone has any suggestions about how to outgrow this mentality. Thank you. "
b001257e-d6b6-4b63-b247-1bf32c050fa5,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone,

I’m 23 and just started my first startup. I’ve been speaking with a lot of entrepreneurs who either fundraised or are fundraising and I’ve noticed it’s either you’re searching for the right people that will fund you when your most busy or you just too early to get funded meaning you have an idea with no tangible results. 

So I thought, what if there was a simple and proactive way for entrepreneurs not just achieve those results with advice, but also build key relationships with investors and other experts in their space that will give them advantages to succeed. This way, they can build more opportunities as they grow close relationships on their ventures.

So after a few months I started building a space that makes it possible to find those kinds of resources (also making it feel less like a full time job).

Now I’m looking for people who want to take that proactive step towards their growth by making the meeting the right people as they grow their businesses, who would be interested in interacting and meeting other cool people. Literally doing business with you. In a place you’re able to track your growth, discuss current trends, share opportunities, and fund ventures you align with.

If you find yourself wanting to build a tight network of people you align with that you can also grow with and invest in, Dm me and I’ll invite you.

Hoping this doesn’t seem suspicious! 

Let’s meet!! "

The webinar doesnt show length nor the ability to fast foreward.

I was watching it today and my adhd couldnt handle how long it was and not being able to foreward it.

71debf5b-2533-4b1c-87cd-94c45027d32f,Entrepreneur,"Hey r/entrepreneur,

So, I recently posted here about my prop-tech startup and my search for investors. I got a few responses, but one interaction has left me scratching my head—and honestly, it’s giving me major scam vibes. I need your help figuring out if I’m overthinking this or if I just dodged a bullet.

Here’s the story:

Someone reached out to me on Reddit, expressing interest in my startup. At first, I was excited—finally, someone who sees the potential in what I’m building! I spent a good 20 minutes typing out a detailed response, explaining my business model, revenue projections, and valuation. I even shared my website (still under development, so don’t judge too hard, haha) and laid out the potential ROI for investors.

But then, things started to feel… off.

First, they asked for a **3% loss pool**, which they said would be held in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA) to cover potential future losses. I asked for more details on how this would work, but they just repeated the same thing without explaining further. Okay, weird, but maybe I’m just not familiar with this practice?

Next, I suggested moving the conversation to LinkedIn to verify identities and make things more official. Their response? “I don’t use LinkedIn—it’s full of spam and bots.” Uh, what? That felt like a red flag, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

Then, I asked for a quick video call to go over everything. They completely dodged the request and stopped responding as soon as I asked for their email to share some documents. At this point, I’m 99% sure this is a scam, but I’m curious—has anyone else encountered something like this?

Here’s what I’m wondering:

* **Is this a common scam tactic?** If so, how does it usually play out? Like, if I had agreed to the 3% loss pool and set up an escrow, how would the scammer actually benefit?
* **What other scams should I watch out for while raising funds?** I’m in a bit of a time crunch and don’t want to waste energy on sketchy interactions.
* **How do you vet potential investors to avoid scams?** I’d love to hear your tips and experiences.

I’m all ears—thanks in advance for your help! You guys are the best."

72834f41-fbad-476b-8392-5508c3daeadf,nature,"We may also take advantage of the two-way traffic between the locus coeruleus and the body. The blue dot is part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls unconscious physiological functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. This is divided into two arms: the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for triggering a stress response, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which sets the body for rest and relaxation. And it seems that we can selectively activate each arm with different physical activities. 

Moderate to intense exercise – walking, running, rowing, cycling, or boxing – is likely to kick the sympathetic arm into action, accelerating the blue dot's activity and increasing our mental arousal. That's great news if you're feeling groggy in the morning and need to wake up, but less useful when you're trying to calm your mind after a hard day's toil. You may think that physical exertion will tire you out, but if you're already having trouble sleeping, late-night gym visits are a bad idea.

Gentle stretching, on the other hand, can promote a relaxation response in the parasympathetic nervous system that simultaneously calms our thoughts and feelings. Controlled breathing exercises, such as pranayama – an ancient breathing technique that stems from yogic practices – appear to do the same job, with slower respiratory rhythms reducing overall arousal.


We can use this to our advantage as we wind down at night. Various trials suggest that meditation and mindful movements can reduce the time it takes to get to sleep, and improve our overall sleep quality, over and above the standard treatments for insomnia.


We do not quite have a physical switch that can turn down our mental activity at will. By managing our daily routine, however, and harnessing the mind-body connection, we will have a much better chance of getting the deep rest that we need."

Paul Virilio, Politics of the Very Worst If you’ve been following the rise of large language models (LLMs) over the past year or so, you’ve probably seen many posts on social media like this one . In this tweet, the author shares a picture of a sight not uncommon in big cities with complex transportation networks – a tall sign with densely packed rules for parking at a specific location stacked one on top of the other. The author feeds a photo of this sign into an LLM (In this case, ChatGPT 4) and asks it to clearly and succinctly determine if parking is allowed at this location at a specific time. The result is impressive — ChatGPT distills a dizzyingly complex set of rules into a simple, one-sentence answer. While this might seem like a trivial use of artificial intelligence (AI) apps and services, it’s actually a very precise encapsulation of both the promise of using LLMs and other AI tools to simplify government information, as well as the perils. Government agencies adopting generative AI tools seems inevitable at this point. Increasingly, agencies are being sold on the power of these new tools to make complex government information and rules easier to find and understand. But there is more than one possible future for how agencies use generative AI to simplify complex government information. What can parking signs tell us about the potential of generative AI and which possible future we are moving toward? Government information is complex As evidenced by that ridiculously tall stack of parking signs, government information is often complex and challenging to understand. The parking rules in the tweet referenced above are not a bad proxy for other kinds of rules that governments create. This information is typically dense, often filled with jargon and acronyms, and can be scattered across multiple locations. Even for those who want to follow the rules, it can be difficult because of the complexity of the information. Simplifying and streamlining complex government rules is often a difficult, time-consuming, and complex undertaking. The better solution to the parking problem at the location in the image above would be to create a single, unified sign with clear rules. But that can be hard. Parking rules, like other rules that government agencies create, are modified over long periods. A single parking location may be subject to multiple jurisdictions — county, city, transportation district, and school district — each with different rules. The cost of coordinating information from these different jurisdictions and simplifying it is more expensive than simply making the signpost higher, and adding a new sign when the rules change. And the cheaper option typically wins out. In this way, parking rules are not so different from the rules that govern taxes or government benefit programs. These rule sets are developed over long periods and are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple government agencies and different levels of government. Efforts are underway to streamline the rules for these programs and make them easier for people to understand and follow , but time and effort are the critical ingredients. The equivalent of making the signpost higher and adding another sign is still the norm. The promise of AI and LLMs Over the past year alone, every single level of government from the smallest town office to the largest federal agency has been inundated with information (and product offerings) that leverage the power of generative AI and LLMs. ChatGPT, OpenAI’s LLM-powered chatbot service that launched in late 2022 and fostered popular interest in LLMs, is reported to be the most rapidly adopted consumer technology in history . These tools are remarkably good at distilling complex information into easy-to-understand bits of content. They are not perfect, and there are many potential risks of using LLMs that have been well documented. Still, their ability to distill complex information is impressive and is improving at an accelerated rate as more investments and research are funneled into these new tools. Most federal agencies, and many states and cities, are adopting new AI policies to govern how employees use LLM tools. Widespread LLM adoption by government agencies at this point seems like a foregone conclusion. If that’s right, then it warrants thinking about the possible futures that might arise from this. How might governments use LLMs to change the way they interact with the public, and what are the implications of these potential choices? How governments use LLMs matters Governments may choose to use LLMs as a tool for changing the way that people navigate complex rule sets or information published on agency websites. They might use LLMs to rewrite and reorganize their web content, making it easier for people to understand . They might use these AI tools to assist customer service agents who often deal with people with complex problems or who face challenges to web-based content or mobile applications. Alternatively, and of some concern, governments might opt to forgo reworking their complex rules and information and simply rely on the ubiquity of new generative AI tools to assist people in consuming government information. Remember the parking sign example discussed above – even though reworking a huge stack of complex signs into a coherent, succinct set of rules for parking in one location may make the most sense, the easiest and cheapest option typically wins out. It’s expensive and time-consuming to rework complex rule sets that have been modified and added to over long periods. If history is any guide, the adoption of AI and LLM tools will follow similar patterns as other consumer technologies. They will continue to become more powerful and more ubiquitous. This is important for governments because as people’s habits and expectations for consuming information and conducting transactions evolve, governments will need to adapt how they interact with the people they serve. The ubiquity of AI and LLMs has implications for how governments design the experience of interacting with those who use government services, just as the ubiquity of the web browser did. But history also tells us that as new consumer technologies become more popular, access to these new tools will not be distributed evenly . People at the higher end of the income distribution, those with more advanced education and digital literacy skills, and those in closer proximity to the infrastructure supporting the internet will have greater access to these tools. As governments incorporate AI and LLM-powered tools into the experience of using digital services, they must factor in (and offset) this unequal distribution of access to new tools. With AI and LLMs set to dramatically transform how governments operate in the years ahead, it has never been more important for governments to focus on and improve the experience of using digital services . Understanding the barriers people face today in accessing and using government services is critical. If governments don’t address these issues today and take steps to improve the experience of using digital services , these disparities will be calcified by the advancement of new AI and LLM tools. The choices that governments make in the coming months and years in adopting these new technologies will determine which future we will get. While there is enormous promise in using these tools to streamline complex government information, there is also tremendous peril. https://civic.io/2024/02/27/parking-signs-and-possible-futures-for-llms-in-government/ #AI #artificialIntelligence #ChatGPT #llm #technology"

85cfffaa-57f5-4914-99a3-c3e4aa70df38,science,"Paul Abela says: ""We’re going to pay the price for turning the world into a giant farm."" _______________________________ The idea that Earth is a giant farm may feel like an exaggeration. It’s not like we’re being overrun by farm animals. And when we look at images of Earth, we see forests that stretch beyond the horizon. We see awe-inspiring landscapes and angelic beaches. What we don’t look at are the vast swathes of land that have been converted into farmland. We’ve become so detached from food production that we tend to disregard how food is produced. Today half of all the habitable land on Earth is used for agriculture. While 23% of that land is used to grow crops, 77% is used to produce meat and dairy. Just 3% of the world’s natural ecosystems, that is, ecosystems uninfluenced by humanity, remain intact. Nature documentaries create an impression that wild animals are abundant. But human interference with ecosystems has led to catastrophic declines in the populations of living species. _______________________________ There's a lot more in the article, including all the damaging pollution associated with meat eating, the destruction of rainforests, the devastating loss of biodiversity, and the advent of a sixth mass extinction. I hope you'll read the whole thing. FULL ARTICLE -- https://www. transformatise.com/2024/03/a-r ecipe-for-disaster/ # Food # Vegan # Science # Environment # Climate # ClimateChange"

Эти вещества не относится к биоразлагаемым. Авторы статьи в Science идентифицировали бактериальный фермент цитохром P450, способный разрушать связи между углеродом и кремнием в линейных метилсилоксанах. Применение искусственной эволюции позволило повысить эффективность этого процесса, а также расширить функциональность фермента на циклические соединения. Результаты работы могут стать основой для разработки методов биологической переработки силоксанов."

5fdd18e5-8e25-4fac-987a-4d9381e0176b,science,"So transness exists in many animals and not just humans. It's been observed but I'm going to give you a personal story from my personal life. My exwife was a wildlife rehabilitator. She went to school for it with a specialization in Raptors. That's birds of prey. Not Jurrassic Park. They rehabilitate most birds but some just can't be released. If they can get along with people they become educational ambassadors. IE birds they take out to the public to educate on wildlife conservation and eliminate misconceptions etc etc. Well they have a mated for life Golden Eagle duo. The boy is a little big but not so large that he's in lady eagle territory. In Raptors sexual dimorphism is reversed. It's important for later. He has a wife. Golden Eagles mate for life. They do all the parnter things. Guard eggs. Have s3x. Normal stuff. but zero viable young. No young at all. They think maybe it's just a biproduct of the lady having West Nile virus. Organs move around and change in birds with west nile. It wouldn't be strange if she were infertile. Because these birds are generally traumatized, and sexing of birds is prone to error they just don't do it. He acts like a guy. He is a guy. His lady love loves him very much. Well he dies of old age. It happens. It's sad. So they do an autopsy. Also routine. Also for science. What is it they find in autopsy? Ovaries. No testes. No intersex condition. This eagle is a big masculine boy with ovaries. They had a married heterosexual couple with a trans guy and a cis gal ... if birds could be referred to by such terms. Being trans isn't new. It's not a fad or a woke mind virus. It's not the Democrats or the Greens or the Hippies. It is observed in most animals capable of actually making advanced neural pathways. Some of the smartest creatures on earth are actually birds of prey. So guess where much transness is found? That's right Eagles, Hawks and owls. It's not weird. It's not unnatural. It's part of the normal distribution of thinking species. #Trans #lgbt #raptors #science #wildlife"

""knowledge, music, flowing water, abundance and wealth, art, speech, wisdom, and learning"". Our greater world can also benefit from HUGE downloads of these qualities for each individual on the planet to bring into PRESENCE through our daily lives. Beyond our physical bodies, each of us, are both - Male & Female. If we attach too much to our genders then disharmonious issues arise. #music #Rey-Kjavik #Saraswati #Goddess #Wisdom #Qualities for #Everyone"

e453a655-39cc-4c2e-9e6c-5412444f9d10,technology,"When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution… Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress. Paul Virilio, Politics of the Very Worst If you’ve been following the rise of large language models (LLMs) over the past year or so, you’ve probably seen many posts on social media like this one . In this tweet, the author shares a picture of a sight not uncommon in big cities with complex transportation networks – a tall sign with densely packed rules for parking at a specific location stacked one on top of the other. The author feeds a photo of this sign into an LLM (In this case, ChatGPT 4) and asks it to clearly and succinctly determine if parking is allowed at this location at a specific time. The result is impressive — ChatGPT distills a dizzyingly complex set of rules into a simple, one-sentence answer. While this might seem like a trivial use of artificial intelligence (AI) apps and services, it’s actually a very precise encapsulation of both the promise of using LLMs and other AI tools to simplify government information, as well as the perils. Government agencies adopting generative AI tools seems inevitable at this point. Increasingly, agencies are being sold on the power of these new tools to make complex government information and rules easier to find and understand. But there is more than one possible future for how agencies use generative AI to simplify complex government information. What can parking signs tell us about the potential of generative AI and which possible future we are moving toward? Government information is complex As evidenced by that ridiculously tall stack of parking signs, government information is often complex and challenging to understand. The parking rules in the tweet referenced above are not a bad proxy for other kinds of rules that governments create. This information is typically dense, often filled with jargon and acronyms, and can be scattered across multiple locations. Even for those who want to follow the rules, it can be difficult because of the complexity of the information. Simplifying and streamlining complex government rules is often a difficult, time-consuming, and complex undertaking. The better solution to the parking problem at the location in the image above would be to create a single, unified sign with clear rules. But that can be hard. Parking rules, like other rules that government agencies create, are modified over long periods. A single parking location may be subject to multiple jurisdictions — county, city, transportation district, and school district — each with different rules. The cost of coordinating information from these different jurisdictions and simplifying it is more expensive than simply making the signpost higher, and adding a new sign when the rules change. And the cheaper option typically wins out. In this way, parking rules are not so different from the rules that govern taxes or government benefit programs. These rule sets are developed over long periods and are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple government agencies and different levels of government. Efforts are underway to streamline the rules for these programs and make them easier for people to understand and follow , but time and effort are the critical ingredients. The equivalent of making the signpost higher and adding another sign is still the norm. The promise of AI and LLMs Over the past year alone, every single level of government from the smallest town office to the largest federal agency has been inundated with information (and product offerings) that leverage the power of generative AI and LLMs. ChatGPT, OpenAI’s LLM-powered chatbot service that launched in late 2022 and fostered popular interest in LLMs, is reported to be the most rapidly adopted consumer technology in history . These tools are remarkably good at distilling complex information into easy-to-understand bits of content. They are not perfect, and there are many potential risks of using LLMs that have been well documented. Still, their ability to distill complex information is impressive and is improving at an accelerated rate as more investments and research are funneled into these new tools. Most federal agencies, and many states and cities, are adopting new AI policies to govern how employees use LLM tools. Widespread LLM adoption by government agencies at this point seems like a foregone conclusion. If that’s right, then it warrants thinking about the possible futures that might arise from this. How might governments use LLMs to change the way they interact with the public, and what are the implications of these potential choices? How governments use LLMs matters Governments may choose to use LLMs as a tool for changing the way that people navigate complex rule sets or information published on agency websites. They might use LLMs to rewrite and reorganize their web content, making it easier for people to understand . They might use these AI tools to assist customer service agents who often deal with people with complex problems or who face challenges to web-based content or mobile applications. Alternatively, and of some concern, governments might opt to forgo reworking their complex rules and information and simply rely on the ubiquity of new generative AI tools to assist people in consuming government information. Remember the parking sign example discussed above – even though reworking a huge stack of complex signs into a coherent, succinct set of rules for parking in one location may make the most sense, the easiest and cheapest option typically wins out. It’s expensive and time-consuming to rework complex rule sets that have been modified and added to over long periods. If history is any guide, the adoption of AI and LLM tools will follow similar patterns as other consumer technologies. They will continue to become more powerful and more ubiquitous. This is important for governments because as people’s habits and expectations for consuming information and conducting transactions evolve, governments will need to adapt how they interact with the people they serve. The ubiquity of AI and LLMs has implications for how governments design the experience of interacting with those who use government services, just as the ubiquity of the web browser did. But history also tells us that as new consumer technologies become more popular, access to these new tools will not be distributed evenly . People at the higher end of the income distribution, those with more advanced education and digital literacy skills, and those in closer proximity to the infrastructure supporting the internet will have greater access to these tools. As governments incorporate AI and LLM-powered tools into the experience of using digital services, they must factor in (and offset) this unequal distribution of access to new tools. With AI and LLMs set to dramatically transform how governments operate in the years ahead, it has never been more important for governments to focus on and improve the experience of using digital services . Understanding the barriers people face today in accessing and using government services is critical. If governments don’t address these issues today and take steps to improve the experience of using digital services , these disparities will be calcified by the advancement of new AI and LLM tools. The choices that governments make in the coming months and years in adopting these new technologies will determine which future we will get. While there is enormous promise in using these tools to streamline complex government information, there is also tremendous peril. https://civic.io/2024/02/27/parking-signs-and-possible-futures-for-llms-in-government/ #AI #artificialIntelligence #ChatGPT #llm #technology"

""The Bicentennial Man"" was my favorite i think, followed by ""The Tercentenary Incident"" and maybe a few of the Susan Calvin stories. obviously he got a lot of things wrong—we're still quite far humanoid robots who do our chores for us. but one thing that rings accurate in the 2020s is a story called ""The Evitable Conflict"", where earth's governments supply supercomputers with loads of data which subsequently spit out advice on how to proceed. the supercomputers start behaving strangely, and the protagonist, looking for answers, realizes that no one really understands how they work. every iteration, new engineers build on previous models, feeding more and more data into them, until they become orders of complexity greater than anyone could control. a few years ago, a paper on LLM transformers concluded ""We offer no explanation as to why these architectures seem to work; we attribute their success, as all else, to divine benevolence."" generative AI is becoming widely used, yet remains poorly understood. maybe we should be at least a little worried about that. # literature # scifi # technology # ai"

f8de10bd-dc9f-48ae-a34b-ed0673a49455,science,"Paul Abela says: ""We’re going to pay the price for turning the world into a giant farm."" _______________________________ The idea that Earth is a giant farm may feel like an exaggeration. It’s not like we’re being overrun by farm animals. And when we look at images of Earth, we see forests that stretch beyond the horizon. We see awe-inspiring landscapes and angelic beaches. What we don’t look at are the vast swathes of land that have been converted into farmland. We’ve become so detached from food production that we tend to disregard how food is produced. Today half of all the habitable land on Earth is used for agriculture. While 23% of that land is used to grow crops, 77% is used to produce meat and dairy. Just 3% of the world’s natural ecosystems, that is, ecosystems uninfluenced by humanity, remain intact. Nature documentaries create an impression that wild animals are abundant. But human interference with ecosystems has led to catastrophic declines in the populations of living species. _______________________________ There's a lot more in the article, including all the damaging pollution associated with meat eating, the destruction of rainforests, the devastating loss of biodiversity, and the advent of a sixth mass extinction.

9fefeee8-ef1b-4023-a133-69c1c6259e52,science,"So transness exists in many animals and not just humans. It's been observed but I'm going to give you a personal story from my personal life. My exwife was a wildlife rehabilitator. She went to school for it with a specialization in Raptors. That's birds of prey. Not Jurrassic Park. They rehabilitate most birds but some just can't be released. If they can get along with people they become educational ambassadors. IE birds they take out to the public to educate on wildlife conservation and eliminate misconceptions etc etc. Well they have a mated for life Golden Eagle duo. The boy is a little big but not so large that he's in lady eagle territory. In Raptors sexual dimorphism is reversed. It's important for later. He has a wife. Golden Eagles mate for life. They do all the parnter things. Guard eggs. Have s3x. Normal stuff. but zero viable young. No young at all. They think maybe it's just a biproduct of the lady having West Nile virus. Organs move around and change in birds with west nile. It wouldn't be strange if she were infertile. Because these birds are generally traumatized, and sexing of birds is prone to error they just don't do it. He acts like a guy. He is a guy. His lady love loves him very much. Well he dies of old age. It happens. It's sad. So they do an autopsy. Also routine. Also for science. What is it they find in autopsy? Ovaries. No testes. No intersex condition. This eagle is a big masculine boy with ovaries. They had a married heterosexual couple with a trans guy and a cis gal ... if birds could be referred to by such terms. Being trans isn't new. It's not a fad or a woke mind virus. It's not the Democrats or the Greens or the Hippies. It is observed in most animals capable of actually making advanced neural pathways. Some of the smartest creatures on earth are actually birds of prey. So guess where much transness is found? That's right Eagles, Hawks and owls. It's not weird. It's not unnatural. It's part of the normal distribution of thinking species. #Trans #lgbt #raptors #science #wildlife"

He was born in Lyon on 29th June 1900 and disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea on 31st July 1945 during a reconnaissance flight.
